Two weeks ago, I reported that the [11th-gen Core i3 Lenovo Flex 5i Chromebook with 8GB of RAM debuted at $549.99](https://www.aboutchromebooks.com/news/mwc-2021-lenovo-chromebook-5i-and-flex-5i-debut-look-great-on-paper/). That's a Costco deal and a step up from the base model. You can still purchase that configuration from Costco, but if you can get by with less memory and system storage, you can [get the base model for $424.99 directly from Lenovo](https://www.lenovo.com/us/en/laptops/lenovo/student-chromebooks/IdeaPad-Flex-5i-Chromebook-Gen-6/p/WMD00000497).

On the one hand, that's a $115 savings from the $539.99 suggested retail price. On the other hand, you're dropping down to 4 GB of memory and 64 GB of slower eMMC storage. The higher-priced configuration provides 128 GB of faster NVMe local storage.

Here's a refresh of the full specs on this updated 11th-gen Core i3 Lenovo Flex 5i, which is very similar to [last year's model that I really liked as a mid-range choice.](https://www.aboutchromebooks.com/news/lenovo-flex-5-chromebook-hands-on-and-first-impressions/)

All in all, this discounted price isn't a bad deal. The newest 11th-gen Core i3 in the Lenovo Flex 5i Chromebook from packs a decent performance punch. A full HD display is nice even if it's not the brightest in the world. The real choice becomes: can you live with 4GB of memory since you can't upgrade that on your own? To a lesser extent, there is slower storage with less capacity too, but my primary concern would be the memory.

For everyday browsing with a reasonable amount of tabs open -- say 10 or less -- at a time, I don't think the memory limitation will ever rear its ugly head. Once you add more browser tabs, Android and/or Linux apps is when you'll wish for more memory. If that's not the way you work, it's a pretty good deal that should meet your needs!

Keep in mind that you can often get [the 4 GB version of last year's model with 10th-gen Core i3 for even less](https://www.aboutchromebooks.com/news/this-lenovo-chromebook-flex-5-sale-is-almost-as-good-as-the-amazon-prime-day-deal/) than both of the deals. Most recently, I saw that one cost $342. Something to consider...
