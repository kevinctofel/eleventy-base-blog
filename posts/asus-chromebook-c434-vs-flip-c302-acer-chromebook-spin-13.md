I thought [Asus had announced all of its Chromebook news before the Consumer Electronics Show started](https://www.aboutchromebooks.com/news/asus-chromebook-tablet-ct100-specifications/). They got me though: [Debuting at CES 2019 is the Asus Chromebook C434](https://edgeup.asus.com/2019/the-chromebook-c434-is-a-professional-2-in-1-laptop-made-for-working-anywhere/) flip model but the device is still in the works. Even so, on paper, it has just about everything you'd want in a follow up to the Flip C302, from fresh new processors to a large display with minimal bezels.

Let's hit the specs first, then discuss what they'll mean for potential buyers as well as a few comparisons to the prior model, starting with the three fanless processor configurations:

- Intel Core M3-8100Y, 2C/4T, 1.1GHz (4MB cache, up to 3.4GHz)
- Intel Core i5-8200Y, 2C/4T, 1.3GHz (4MB cache, up to 3.9GHz)
- Intel Core i7-8500Y, 2C/4T, 1.5GHz (4MB cache, up to 4.2GHz)
- 14‚Äù LED-backlit IPS NanoEdge display, 100% sRGB, 1920 x 1080 with 5mm bezels and 360-degree hinge
- Up to 8GB LPDDR3
- Up to 128GB eMMC
- MicroSD card reader, 802.11ac Wi-Fi, Bluetooth 4.0
- Two USB Type-C ports, one USB Type-A port (all ports are USB 3.1)
- Backlit keyboard and multi-touch trackpad
- HD webcam, presumably 720p based on the lack of a "FullHD" mention
- 48 WHr battery, no estimated run-time yet
- 3.2 pounds

About the only thing missing would be a digital stylus and support for it with the Asus Chromebook 434. I'd prefer a slightly higher resolution display, but that's just me. I've also moved away from widescreen displays; not everyone else has though. That display is a big upgrade from the C302, which only showed 45% of the NTSC color gamut. This one supports 100% sRGB color, which is a huge improvement. I don't expect this device to be used much as a tablet due to its size, weight and the rounded bottom edge: The display won't quite fold flat against the entire base.

The processor choices are the [same 8th-generation Y-Series options found in the Pixel Slate](https://www.aboutchromebooks.com/reviews/google-pixel-slate-review/), minus the Celeron option, so the new Flip should easily handle numerous tabs, Android and Linux apps with ease, especially when paired with 8 GB of memory, although I suspect the base model will have half that.

Since I mentioned the Pixel Slate and its comparable models, which start at $799 without a keyboard, let's think about pricing since Asus hasn't determined that yet.

Aside from the step down from Intel U-Series to Y-Series chips, as well as screen resolution, the new Asus Chromebook C434 is similar to the Acer Chromebook Spin 13; [I reviewed the $899 Core i5 model of that device](https://www.aboutchromebooks.com/reviews/acer-chromebook-spin-13-review-vs-pixelbook/) and it was fantastic. I'm thinking that the similarly configured Asus Chromebook C434 models will be between $100 and $150 less than the 13 Spin. Extrapolate that out and you get $650 or so for the mid-range C434, with the base hopefully starting at $549 to $599.

If, and it's a big if yet, that price scheme holds true when Asus starts selling this Chromebook in the coming months, you'll be getting a lot of Chromebook for the money and you won't need to spend $800 to $1,000 to get it. Put another way: If Asus can start this device at $549, I think it will have a huge success in the market with the Chromebook C434.
