Since Chrome OS is decidedly different from traditional operating systems, some folks don't "get it" quickly, which can lead to frustration or the false impression that Chrome OS is just a browser. This is especially true for students who have Chromebooks in the classroom but may have only seen their parent's Windows or Mac computers.

Chrome Story published a [handy, free guide to Chromebook basics](https://www.chromestory.com/2018/04/free-chromebook-guide-students) that's filled with good tips to help you get up to speed on your new Chromebook quickly. Ranging from shortcut tips to touchpad tricks and everything in between, this guide can fill you in on how Chrome OS works.

I'd also add that if you want to see all of the keyboard shortcuts in Chrome OS, and there's a ton of them, just press _ctrl+alt+?_ on your keyboard for an overlay of them. You can even press a key -- such as _Shift_ - and the overlay will change to show you all of the modifier shortcuts associated with that key.
