Yesterday, [Lenovo outed its 15.6-inch Yoga Chromebook C630](https://news.lenovo.com/pressroom/press-releases/lenovo-reveals-smartest-devices-techlife-18.htm) and one of my favorite video reviewers, not to mention one of the nicest people on the planet, has a brief video look. Mr. Mobile took the desktop replacement for a short drive, explaining who this device is for. With the large display it looks ideal for video streaming, but check the video for additional thoughts.

The video also confirms something [I noted yesterday about the Chromebook's pricing](https://www.aboutchromebooks.com/news/4k-lenovo-yoga-chromebook-c630-specs-price-release-date-599/). About half of the news stories claimed a $599 cost while the other half reported $749. Based on the video -- and the spec sheet with cost I previously found -- the $599 price is the base model with 1080p display and 64GB of eMMC 5.1 storage. For $749, you get the same base specs with an upgrade to the 4K screen and double the local storage.

Both models use the [Intel Core i5-8250U](https://ark.intel.com/products/124967/Intel-Core-i5-8250U-Processor-6M-Cache-up-to-3_40-GHz) processor, have 8GB of memory, a pair of USB Type-C ports, single USB Type-A, 2W stereo speakers, headphone jack, webcam and microSD card slot.

This isn't a device I'd likely tote around much since it weighs 4.2 pounds. For strictly or mainly in-home use though? Sure! It would be ideal not just for 4K video content -- I'd go for that model personally -- but also for app development via Linux apps on [Project Crostini](https://www.aboutchromebooks.com/tag/project-crostini). Running integrated development environments and text editors with a screen that large would be fantastic!
