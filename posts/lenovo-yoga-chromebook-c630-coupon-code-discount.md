Over the summer, it seemed that there were huge sales on Chromebooks every week. As the season comes to end, however, those discounts seem to have dried up a bit. But today I did find a solid one on the [high-end Lenovo Yoga Chromebook C630](https://www.lenovo.com/us/en/laptops/lenovo/lenovo-n-series/Yoga-Chromebook/p/81JX0007UX) for those who want a powerful device and large display.

Lenovo currently has a 15% off coupon code (YOGA15) that drops the price of its 15.6-inch 1080p Yoga Chromebook to $611.99, which easily beats the current $699 price at Best Buy.

Strangely, on my Chromebook, the Lenovo website only shows the 1080p model as available. However, on my phone, the same site _also_ shows the 4K version and the same coupon code for the 15% price reduction at $764.99.

The only difference between the two models is the display resolution as everything else is the same:

- 8th-Generation Intel Core i5-8250U processor (which uses a fan for cooling)
- Integrated Intel UHD Graphics 620
- 15.6-inch IPS touch panel
- 8 GB of memory
- 128 GB of eMMC storage
- Bluetooth 4.1
- 802.11ac Wi-Fi (2 x 2 MIMO)
- 720p HD camera
- 2 USB Type-C ports, 1 USB Type-A port
- Backlit keyboard
- MicroSD card slot

Although my eyesight is getting progressively worse and I'm moving up in screen sizes, a 15.6-inch Chromebook is more than I'd like to carry around. Plus I wanted more RAM, which is why I recently opted for a refurbished [Acer Chromebook Spin 13 with 16 GB of memory](https://www.aboutchromebooks.com/news/acer-chromebook-spin-13-with-16-gb-ram-should-you-buy-one/).

That device generally has the same other internals as the Lenovo but does have an included stylus, and even though it was heavily discounted, it still cost me $819. All things considered then, a Lenovo Yoga Chromebook C630 for $200 less than that is a pretty good deal if you have the budget.
