Last week, Microsoft debuted an updated [Skype for Web](https://web.skype.com) service with far more restrictions that it previously had. Essentially, you can _only_ use the web client of Skype in either the Microsoft Edge or Google Chrome browsers now. Safari and Firefox users need not apply.

Although Chrome is supported, if you try to use Skype for Web on a Chrome OS device, you'll likely see the dreaded "browser not supported" message. Why is that? Very likely because Microsoft isn't just checking your browser but also you computer hardware. The [company's support page suggests this](https://support.skype.com/en/faq/fa10328/what-are-the-system-requirements-for-skype) by saying:

> We recommend that you be on Windows 10 or Mac OSX 10.12 or higher to use Skype for Web.Â   
>   
> **Note**: Users on Windows 7 or Windows 8/8.1 may be able to sign in but may not receive the full experience of Skype for Web.  
>   
> Skype for Web is not supported on mobile phones or tablets.

Indeed, I've even seen a "device not supported" message as well while trying to regain access to the Skype web client.

Fear not, Chromebook owners. There's a trick that works, at least for now, using one of the first extensions I always install or sync over onto a new Chrome OS device. It's called [User-Agent Switcher](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/user-agent-switcher/clddifkhlkcojbojppdojfeeikdkgiae?hl=en) and with it, you can "simulate" another device or browser by choosing from a number of configuration options.

I first tested Skype for Web with the User-Agent Switcher set as "Chrome on Windows" but that didn't work. Luckily, choosing "Microsoft Edge on Windows" did work: With this setting on, I was able to place a Skype call in my browser.

Another obvious alternative is to install the Android version of Skype, which still works. But for a quick web call or chat, sometimes the browser is my client of choice. Now it still can be.
