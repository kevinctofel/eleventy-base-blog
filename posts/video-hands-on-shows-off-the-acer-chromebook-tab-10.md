Aside from announcing both [powerful 13-inch Chromebooks](https://www.aboutchromebooks.com/news/new-acer-chromebook-spin-13-chromebook-13-launching-at-acer-next-event/) and [15-inch value options](https://www.aboutchromebooks.com/news/acer-introduces-chromebook-spin-15-covertible-and-chromebook-15/) on Wednesday, Acer was also showing off its previously announced Chromebook Tab 10. We're still [waiting on a release date for the $329 Chrome OS tablet](https://www.aboutchromebooks.com/news/looks-like-the-acer-chromebook-tab-10-release-date-is-june-or-later/) but at least we have a better idea of how the slate looks and works thanks to my former co-blogger from a decade ago, Brad Linder.

At Brad's Liliputing site, he posted [a hands-on look at the Chromebook Tab 10](https://liliputing.com/2018/05/hands-on-with-the-acer-chromebook-tab-10.html) and it's worth the look if you're considering a purchase of this tablet.

I agree with Brad that this is likely the way Android tablets will move forward over time: Running on Chrome OS with the addition of Android app through the Google Play Store. That [combination of a full desktop browser with mobile apps is the game changer](https://www.aboutchromebooks.com/opinion/why-chrome-tablets-will-be-a-game-changer/) I've been hoping for since 2012 as Chrome OS started to gain a more touch friendly interface.

It sounds like Brad asked Acer if the company would be making a keyboard attachment for the Chromebook Tab 10 but no dice: You'll need to supply your own. A wireless Bluetooth keyboard would do the trick although I suspect that USB-OTG is supported -- we'll have to test it and see -- for those who want to use a wired keyboard.
