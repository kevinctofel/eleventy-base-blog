Did you miss getting a Dell Inspiron Chromebook 14 for $150 off two weeks ago? No problem, because the deal is back again. You can snag this [Core i3-powered 2-in-1 for just $399 at Best Buy](https://www.bestbuy.com/site/dell-inspiron-2-in-1-14-touch-screen-chromebook-intel-core-i3-4gb-memory-128gb-emmc-flash-memory-urban-gray/6299820.p?skuId=6299820).

If you don’t mind an internal fan (which really shouldn’t run often), $399 gets you a strong performing Chromebook with 1080p display and pen support, capable of fast browsing, multiple Android apps and even some Linux software if you decide to enable that option.

Here’s a reminder of the hardware configuration:

- [Intel Core i3-8130U](https://ark.intel.com/content/www/us/en/ark/products/137977/intel-core-i3-8130u-processor-4m-cache-up-to-3-40-ghz.html) processor
- Intel UHD 620 integrated graphics
- 4 GB of memory
- 128 GB of eMMC storage and microSD card slot
- 14.0-inch FHD (1920 x 1080) TrueLife LED Backlight Touch IPS Display with EMR Pen Support (pen included)
- 720p webcam
- Two USB Type-C ports, one USB Type-A port, microphone/headphone jack
- 802.11ac Wi-Fi and Bluetooth 4.2
- 56 WHr battery and 45 Watt charger
- Weight of 3.99 pounds

About the only concern I’d have with the Dell is the 4 GB of memory, although unless you’re more of a power user, this should be fine. Given that I code on my Chromebooks, I’ve always felt [the more RAM the better for my use case](https://www.aboutchromebooks.com/news/acer-chromebook-spin-13-with-16-gb-ram-should-you-buy-one/).

Sales on devices such as this will definitely have some potential Pixelbook Go buyers take pause. Yes, the [$649 Pixelbook Go](https://www.bestbuy.com/site/google-pixelbook-go-13-3-touch-screen-chromebook-intel-core-m3-8gb-memory-64gb-solid-state-drive-just-black/6382912.p?skuId=6382912) has double the RAM but only half the storage and a lower-powered Intel Core m3 U-Series processor. There's no pen support, nor is the Go a 2-in-1 but even if you won't ever use those features, this heavier and thicker Dell Chromebook on sale may be the better deal.
