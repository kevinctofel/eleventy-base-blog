With the [first Chrome tablet arriving later this month](https://aboutchromebooks.com/opinion/why-chrome-tablets-will-be-a-game-changer/), Google is looking to tweak the Chrome OS touch interface to make it more tablet-like. Instead of today's app launcher experience that shows five recent apps, the launcher will instead show in full screen mode, similar to an Android tablet.

[XDA Developers noticed a code change](https://www.xda-developers.com/chrome-os-fullscreen-launcher-tablet-mode/) for testing this but it's not live yet. If the feature progresses into the Chrome OS Stable channel though -- and I assume it will in some form -- this new menu display will come to both the [Acer Chromebook Tab 10](https://www.acer.com/ac/en/US/content/series/acerchromebooktab10) as well as other Chromebooks that can be used in tablet mode.

The full screen menu is really a minor tweak: You can already scroll the app launcher up and see all of your apps on a supported Chromebook. The difference is that it would eliminate the need to scroll the app launcher up.

There's also mention of a home button in the code, which would minimize all windows "instead of "opening/closing the launcher." That makes me wonder if the launcher button will be renamed to the "home" button, similar to the home icon in Android, or if there will be a software home button for this functionality. Either way, it's clear that Google is continuing to evolve Chrome OS so that it's more usable on a tablet or in tablet mode for a convertible Chromebook.
