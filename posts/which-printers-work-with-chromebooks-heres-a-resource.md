Ever since Google announced and then implemented the [deprecation of Cloud Print](https://www.aboutchromebooks.com/news/chrome-os-87-stable-channel-arrives-on-chromebooks-what-you-need-to-know/ "Chrome OS 87 Stable Channel arrives on Chromebooks: What you need to know") at the end of 2020, I've received many questions about printers and Chromebooks. To be honest, most recent printers from the last few years will work. Google has steadily improved printer compatibility with Chrome OS by using industry-standard methods. Even so, I thought it might be a good resource to have indicating which printers work with Chromebooks.

There are currently around 60 Brother printers that are compatible with Chromebooks. A full list of them is [here on Brother's site](https://support.brother.com/g/b/oscontents.aspx?c=us&lang=en&ossid=2). You'll find a range of Brother options including inkjets and laser printers that support both color and monochrome output. There are even a few fax machine printers on the list if you're old school.

Canon printer fans have many more choices, but all are inkjets. Currently, the list includes the following Canon printer series' but [check this link](https://ij.manual.canon/ij/webmanual/WebPortal/PTA/pta_app_models.html?lng=en&type=non&app=chromeos "https://ij.manual.canon/ij/webmanual/WebPortal/PTA/pta_app_models.html?lng=en&type=non&app=chromeos") to see if there are any updates prior to making a purchase:

If you have or are in the market for an Epson printer, there are easily over 100 models that work with Chromebooks[. The range includes Epson Printers And All-In-Ones For Home, Photo Printers for Home, Printers,](https://epson.com/Mobile-Printing-and-Scanning-Solutions/Printing-and-Scanning-Solutions/Chromebook-Printing/p/CHROMEBOOKPRINT#worksWithAccessories "https://epson.com/Mobile-Printing-and-Scanning-Solutions/Printing-and-Scanning-Solutions/Chromebook-Printing/p/CHROMEBOOKPRINT#worksWithAccessories") and all-in-ones for Work, just to name a few. Rather than break them all out, [check or bookmark this list if you prefer Epson](https://epson.com/Mobile-Printing-and-Scanning-Solutions/Printing-and-Scanning-Solutions/Chromebook-Printing/p/CHROMEBOOKPRINT#worksWithAccessories "https://epson.com/Mobile-Printing-and-Scanning-Solutions/Printing-and-Scanning-Solutions/Chromebook-Printing/p/CHROMEBOOKPRINT#worksWithAccessories").

HP is a popular printer brand but the company doesn't break out Chromebook compatibility by model. Instead, HP says that if their printer supports IPP Everywhere, it will work with a Chromebook.

[This page lists all IPP Everywhere printers](https://pwg.org/printers/index.html), currently showing 647 printers from various manufacturers including HP. If you're not familiar with IPP, it's the Internet Printing Protocol standard.

[Lexmark has its own list of about 130 printers that work with Chromebooks that you can find here](https://www.lexmark.com/en_us/solutions/print-solutions/mobile-print-solutions/chrome-enterprise-print-device-support.html "https://www.lexmark.com/en_us/solutions/print-solutions/mobile-print-solutions/chrome-enterprise-print-device-support.html"). I also saw dozens of Lexmark models on the IPP Everywhere page although there's sure to be some overlap.

[Ricoh's list](https://www.ricoh.com/support/chromeos#modellist) is equally as extensive as Lexmark's and the company also provides information about Chrome OS version support and details about the print software. Ricoh provides Google with drivers and other files that work with CUPS, or the Common Unix Printing System, that Chrome OS supports. Note that Ricoh skews more towards enterprise and small business offerings.

Looking at printers from Kyocera? No problem, [these work with Chromebooks](https://www.kyoceradocumentsolutions.com/support/chrome_os/index.html) according to the company:

While printing from a Chromebook used to be a hassle, and likely still is on printers that have seen better days, it's now much improved. You can typically print either over your wireless network or through a USB cable. The key is to have a supported printer and the list of those is growing every year.
