Not happy that the [Samsung Galaxy Chromebook 2 lost features from its predecessor](https://www.aboutchromebooks.com/news/ces-2021-samsung-galaxy-chromebook-2-price-release-date-specifications/) and still costs $699 with a Core i3? I'm with you on that one, given that there are relatively comparable options available for much less. But, a current $200 discount makes this a far better value. I'd even say [this $499 Samsung Galaxy Chromebook 2 sale](https://www.samsung.com/us/computing/chromebook2/buy/) is more what the price should be.

You won't find it at your local retailer or big-box store. And there's no information about when the deal expires.

Frankly, this is the best price I've seen since the device debuted earlier this year. Plus, at $499, it's a more compelling purchase, provided it meets your anticipated needs, of course. Don't buy any device just because of a good deal; it doesn't matter how much money you save if the device doesn't do what you need it to do.

This top configuration should handle the bulk of tasks for a large chunk of Chromebook users though. Everyday browsing, even with a dozen or more tabs shouldn't be a problem. Users who want to run Android and Linux apps should have a decent experience as well thanks to the amount of RAM.

You're getting a 10th-generation Intel Core i3, 8 GB of memory, and 128 GB of local storage, for example. The 13.3-inch display isn't a 4K OLED panel like the original Galaxy Chromebook, but a 1080p QLED panel with a 16:9 aspect ratio will still look great. The battery life of the Galaxy Chromebook 2 is improved over its predecessor as well. Just keep in mind that this Chromebook has a cooling fan.

The Samsung Galaxy Chromebook 2 doesn't come with a pen but it does support a USI stylus if you want to add one. A pair of USB Type C ports, a microSD card slot, integrated web cam and support for WiFi 6 round out the package. All in all, it's a solid mid-range convertible Chromebook that's at a mid-range price. At least for now.
