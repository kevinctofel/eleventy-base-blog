Hot on the heels of the [Acer Chromebook Spin 13 Prime Day deal](https://www.aboutchromebooks.com/news/amazon-prime-day-deal-acer-chromebook-spin-13-300-discount/), here's a price cut on the Samsung Chromebook V2. You can [save a whopping 31 percent on the Celeron version and pay $379.99](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07J215RPT/ref=gbdp_vlo_3607b8ae_B07J215RPT?_encoding=UTF8&smid=ATVPDKIKX0DER).

[Samsung sells this model directly for $499.99](https://www.samsung.com/us/computing/chromebooks/12-14/samsung-chromebook-plus-xe520qab-k01us), which is a bit much for a Celeron-powered device that's [been around since last June](https://www.aboutchromebooks.com/news/samsung-chromebook-plus-v2-release-date-price/). Saving $120 makes the purchase a little more palatable.

Here's what you get:

- Intel Celeron 3965Y fanless processor
- 4 GB of memory
- 64 GB of eMMC storage
- 12.3-inch touch display with 1920 x 1200 resolution
- Included digital pen
- 360-degree hinge
- MicroSD card slot
- Two USB-C ports and one USB Type-A port
- 13-megapixel rear camera and HD front camera
- Expected 10-hour battery life
- Weight of 2.98 pounds

I wasn't thrilled when this updated model arrived with a lower resolution display than the prior edition, but even so: 1920 x 1200 on a 12.3-inch display packs a good number of pixels.

The Celeron and 4 GB of memory can be limiting so if you're a power user that relies heavily on Android apps or keeps dozens of tabs open during the day, you'll want to consider this factor. For everyday browsing, note-taking and general usage though? This is a solid choice.
