In a move that makes Chromebooks and Chrome tablets even more like Android devices, [Google has added long-press app shortcuts to Android apps on Chrome OS](https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/1086118). These behave just as they do on an Android phone: A tap and hold brings up contextual shortcuts.

Don't get too excited to try these just yet though. [According to Google's own François Beaufort](https://plus.google.com/+FrancoisBeaufort/posts/MzmBJX7acyA), you'll have to be running the Dev Channel on your Chrome OS device. Beta and Stable Channel users need not apply as this feature isn't likely to hit those until the [version 69 update that will also bring support for Linux apps](https://www.aboutchromebooks.com/news/project-crostini-linux-apps-chromebooks-release-date-chrome-69/).

Even if you do run on the Dev Channel, you'll need to enable a flag for this feature. Type _chrome://flags/#enable-touchable-app-context-menu_ in your browser and toggle the setting to "Enabled". Restart your browser and you'll be able to quickly get to shortcuts for your Android apps whether they're pinned to the Shelf or in the Chrome OS App Launcher.
