Are you tired of reading about the [Chrome OS 91 software update that locked users out of their Chromebooks](https://www.aboutchromebooks.com/news/another-chrome-os-91-stable-channel-update-has-borked-users-chromebooks/)? I'm certainly tired of writing about it. But there's good news on the immediate horizon: Google will be pushing out a fix to Chrome OS devices on Wednesday, [according to its Customer Care Portal](https://support.cloud.google.com/portal/system-status#:~:text=Chrome%20OS-,Users%20are%20unable%20to%20login%20after%20updating%20to%2091.0.4472.165,-expand_more):

> Our engineering team has identified an issue on Chrome OS 91.0.4472.165. The rollout of this version was halted. A new version which will fix the issue will be available on July 21st, but in the meantime these are the options if you are affected:  
> 1\. Once the new 91 update is available on Wednesday, users will get the new version via auto-update or they can use guest mode to trigger the OS update.  
> 2\. Powerwash the device (local data will be cleared).  
> 3\. Rollback the Chrome OS device to a previous version via USB (local data will be cleared). Once the updated version is available you will need to do one of the following steps: - Leave the Chromebook device on the login screen to download the update via auto-update. - Update the device manually after logging into Guest Mode.  
> We apologise for the inconvenience.

While this is good news, I'm betting that a lot of people have already factory reset their devices. Why? Because they had to get back to work on their devices for one reason or another.

That means they lost any data in the Documents folder unless it was backed up. I wrote about [how to mitigate this issue going forward earlier this morning](https://www.aboutchromebooks.com/news/lessons-to-learn-from-the-chrome-os-91-stable-update-bug-situations/). Essentially: Don't put any data in Documents that you can't afford to lose due to a hardware or software issue.

The entire situation has been disappointing. Short of this Customer Care Center (that I'd never used before), I haven't seen Google publicly acknowledge this issue with the Chrome OS 91 Stable Channel. I guess I'll have to monitor the Customer Care Center going forward.

So.... who here didn't reset their Chromebook and will benefit from the software upgrade tomorrow?
