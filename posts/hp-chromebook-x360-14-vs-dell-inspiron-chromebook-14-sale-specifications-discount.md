If you're in the market for a mid-range Chromebook and have around $450 to spend, you've got an interesting choice to make this week. Based on discounts at Best Buy, both the [HP Chromebook X360 14](https://www.bestbuy.com/site/hp-2-in-1-14-touch-screen-chromebook-intel-core-i3-8gb-memory-64gb-emmc-flash-memory-white/6301869.p?skuId=6301869) and [Dell Inspiron Chromebook 14](https://www.bestbuy.com/site/dell-inspiron-2-in-1-14-touch-screen-chromebook-intel-core-i3-4gb-memory-128gb-emmc-flash-memory-urban-gray/6299820.p?skuId=6299820) are sharing the same $449 price tag.

These 2-in-1 Chromebooks are extremely similar when it comes to the configuration, features, and size. It's probably easier to point out what's actually different about them but in case folks want the full picture, here are the specs with differences in bold.

As I said, these two devices are _extremely_ similar.

They should generally perform the same with Chrome OS, although the extra memory on the HP will help that device. I'd also expect the HP to eke out a little more battery life over the Dell as well. _But_.... if you want 128 GB of local storage and/or a digital stylus, the Dell will better suit your needs.

Either way, it's nice to have a choice at the same price point for two very capable 2-in-1 Chromebooks, which should last all this week.
