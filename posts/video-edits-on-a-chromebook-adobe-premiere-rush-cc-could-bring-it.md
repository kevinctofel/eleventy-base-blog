I've been following this week's [Adobe MAX conference](https://max.adobe.com/) with interest, mainly because one of the current shortfalls of Chrome OS is the lack of truly powerful photo and video editors. That could change soon on the video front as [Adobe introduced its Premiere Rush CC editing app for iOS](https://theblog.adobe.com/create-and-share-online-videos-anywhere-with-all-new-premiere-rush-cc/). How does that help Chromebook users? It doesn't. The fact that Adobe announced an Android version _may_, however.

Here's a peek at [Adobe Premiere Rush CC](https://www.adobe.com/products/premiere-rush.html) on the iPhone, which allows for both shooting and editing video while on the go. After edits, the videos can be shared both to social networks and to YouTube.

There's no timeline on when to expect the Android version at this point. You can [sign up for updates here](https://www.adobe.com/subscription/rushandroidnews.html), however. And we won't know how well it does or doesn't work on a Chromebook until Adobe Premiere Rush CC is available in the Google Play Store. Once it is, I plan to install it on a Chrome OS device right away to see if this is viable for use on a Chromebook or -- thanks to rear facing cameras -- a Chrome tablet such as the [Google Pixel Slate](https://www.aboutchromebooks.com/tag/pixel-slate).

Based on what I've seen so far, Adobe has optimized the app for use on iPads, so of course, my hope is that they've done the same for Android, regardless of device size. Surely it will look nice on the small screen of a phone or a sub-10-inch Android tablet. How will it look on a 12-inch or larger Chrome OS devices though? That's the open question. Since Google is one of the largest sponsors of the Adobe MAX conference, my hope is that these two companies partner for an optimized solution that works well on Chromebooks supporting the Google Play Store.

Keep in mind that if this _does_ become a viable video editing option for Chromebooks, it won't be free. Adobe will charge $9.99 per month to individuals who only want this one product. Premiere Rush CC includedÂ with All Apps, Student and Premiere Pro CC single app plans and comes with 100 GB of CC storage.
