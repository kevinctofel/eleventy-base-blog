It's not the first time the Dell Inspiron Chromebook 14 has been discounted at Best Buy and it surely won't be the last, but you can snag this 2-in-1 with a digital stylus for $100 off this week. [Best Buy is selling Dell's latest Chromebook for $499](https://www.bestbuy.com/site/dell-inspiron-2-in-1-14-touch-screen-chromebook-intel-core-i3-4gb-memory-128gb-emmc-flash-memory-urban-gray/6299820.p?skuId=6299820) through Saturday.

The [Dell Inspiron Chromebook 14 was introduced back in August](https://www.aboutchromebooks.com/news/dell-insipiron-14-chromebook-price-release-date-availability/) and first went on sale this past October but it’s still a solid device, provided you don’t want or need an Intel Core i5 or Core i7 to power you through the day.

Here’s a rundown of the specs:

- [Intel Core i3-8130U](https://ark.intel.com/content/www/us/en/ark/products/137977/intel-core-i3-8130u-processor-4m-cache-up-to-3-40-ghz.html) processor
- Intel UHD 620 integrated graphics
- 4 GB of memory
- 128 GB of eMMC storage and microSD card slot
- 14.0-inch FHD (1920 x 1080) TrueLife LED Backlight Touch IPS Display with EMR Pen Support (pen included)
- 720p webcam
- Two USB Type-C ports, one USB Type-A port, microphone/headphone jack
- 802.11ac Wi-Fi and Bluetooth 4.2
- 56 WHr battery and 45 Watt charger
- Weight of 3.99 pounds

With the Intel Core i3 inside, I'd say this $499 price with these specs is more appropriate than the full $599 MSRP. And I haven't found any reviews - either personal or on other technology sites where anyone was truly disappointed in the Dell Inspiron Chromebook 14.

Indeed, with [99 Dell Inspiron Chromebook 14 buyer reviews](https://www.bestbuy.com/site/reviews/dell-inspiron-2-in-1-14-touch-screen-chromebook-intel-core-i3-4gb-memory-128gb-emmc-flash-memory-urban-gray/6299820) on Best Buy's site alone, the average rating is 4.6 out of 5 and 73% of those reviews are a full 5 out of 5. There were two ratings of a "1" and both were hardware issues. That shouldn't be discounted of course, but any hardware, regardless of who made it, is bound to have a small percentage of hardware issues.

If you're on the fence or have a more limited budget, note that Best Buy is also offering refurbished or returned units that can save you another $30 to $70. You can save even more on some open box units but I'd stick to the ones that are certified or marked as in excellent condition.
