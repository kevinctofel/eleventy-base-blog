Did the $999 price tag of the Samsung Galaxy Chromebook with 4K display keep you from pulling the trigger on a purchase? Maybe a $100 discount will give you the incentive: [Best Buy has the 10th-generation Intel Core i5 convertible Samsung Galaxy Chromebook priced at $899 on sale](http://d-touch-screen-chromebook-intel-core-i5-8gb-memory-256gb-ssd-fiesta-red/6398115.p?skuId=6398115) in your choice of color.

This device is about the highest performing consumer Chromebook you can buy out of the box, which explains the standard $999 price tag.

You could opt for similar specifications and save some money with the $799 [Asus Chromebook Flip C436](https://www.aboutchromebooks.com/news/999-asus-chromebook-flip-c436-now-available-vs-samsung-galaxy-chromebook/), but you're forgoing that gorgeous 4K AMOLED display on the Samsung. And yes, [it really does look good based on my own eyes](https://www.aboutchromebooks.com/news/samsung-galaxy-chromebook-hands-on-yes-its-as-nice-as-it-looks/).

On the downside though, pushing that many pixels takes a toll on the battery life.

[Samsung told me to expect 9 or 10 hours of run time on a single charge](https://www.aboutchromebooks.com/news/samsung-galaxy-chromebook-specifications-release-date-price-ces-2020/) at the January device launch, but [most reviews and user write-ups have fallen well short of those figures](https://www.aboutchromebooks.com/news/samsung-galaxy-chromebook-review-round-up/), which vary by how you use the device. And the fanless cooling system isn't quite as efficient as one with a fan: This Chromebook warms up quickly.

Battery-life and thermal challenges aside, you do get a lot with the Samsung Galaxy Chromebook: The aforementioned Intel Core-i5-10210U processor, 8 GB of memory, 256 GB of SSD local storage, WiFi 6 connectivity, an in-keyboard fingerprint sensor, built-in digital stylus, and a pair of USB-C ports.

Of course, this 9 mm thin device folds 360-degrees for tablet use with or without the stylus. With a 13.3-inch display, this may not be the most comfortable 2-in-1 Chromebook to use in tablet mode, but it's definitely workable for short periods of time. Don't forget, this Chromebook weighs all of 2.29 pounds.

Will a $100 discount sway you to grab a Samsung Galaxy Chromebook in Fiesta Red or Mercury Gray? I'm not in the market for a new Chromebook personally right now. If I was, I'd probably skip this deal.

Not because it's not a good one; any time you can save on a high-end Chromebook or get a nice 4K device at a discount is a win. I'm just too leery of the battery life limitations because I'm often away from an outlet for hours and hours. Perhaps a software update to the Samsung Galaxy Chromebook will address that in the future.
