[We knew it was coming](https://www.aboutchromebooks.com/news/samsung-chromebook-plus-lte/) and today's the day: [The Samsung Chromebook Plus v2 with LTE is official](https://news.samsung.com/us/samsung-chromebook-plus-v2-lte-always-connected/). There are no changes from the Wi-Fi version, which costs $499, other than the addition of a Cat. 9 LTE radio for up to 450Mbps downloads, which adds $100 to the device cost. Monthly service is, of course, an additional charge for mobile broadband connectivity.

Some folks may not be happy about the $100 charge for an LTE radio. Sadly, that's pretty much standard: Adding LTE to a laptop or tablet typically adds $100 to $130, so at least this is on the low end of the spectrum.

In case you forgot what you get in the [Samsung Chromebook Plus v2](https://www.aboutchromebooks.com/news/samsung-chromebook-plus-v2-release-date-price/), here's a quick spec rundown:

A 1.5GHz [Intel Celeron 3965Y](https://ark.intel.com/products/122698/Intel-Celeron-Processor-3965Y-2M-Cache-1_50-GHz) processor, 4GB of memory, a 12.2-inch 1920 x 1080 touch resolution panel with 300 nits and digital stylus support, front and back cameras, microSD card slot, two USB Type-C ports and one USB Type A. The Chromebook supports Android apps from the Google Play Store and is also [on the list of supported devices for Project Crostini](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromiumos/docs/+/master/containers_and_vms.md#Supported-Now), so you can [run Linux apps](https://www.aboutchromebooks.com/news/first-look-running-full-linux-apps-on-a-chromebook-with-project-crostini/) as well.

Although not the most powerful device, the Samsung Chromebook Plus v2 is quite capable with a mid-range price. I wish Samsung hadn't made the second version with a lower resolution display than the first iteration but it still has a full HD screen. The addition of an LTE radio makes it even more capable since you can stay connected without tethering your phone or searching for Wi-Fi.

Samsung says the new Chromebook Plus v2 will be sold directly from its own store and will also be available from both Best Buy and Verizon starting on November 2.
