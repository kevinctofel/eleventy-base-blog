Along with the [new Chromebook Spin 13 and Chromebook 13 debuting today](https://www.aboutchromebooks.com/news/new-acer-chromebook-spin-13-chromebook-13-launching-at-acer-next-event/), Acer also announced larger versions at its Acer Next event: [The Chromebook Spin 15 and Chromebook 15](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/acer-debuts-big-screen-flexibility-with-first-15-inch-convertible-chromebook-300653382.html).

These devices are similar but obviously bigger than the 13-inch models. Acer is using a 15.6-inch IPS display with 1920 x 1080 resolution. The same Gorilla Glass trackpad from the smaller models is there, along with choice of processor. These can be powered by an Intel Pentium N4200 , Celeron N3450, or dual-core Intel Celeron N3350 processor. Memory options are 4 or 8 GB of RAM and either 16 or 32 GB of local storage.

Both have native Google Play Store support although the one thing that appears to be missing from the Spin 15 is a stylus; the 13-inch model includes one. USB-C ports, a microSD slot, 802.11ac Wi-Fi and Bluetooth round out the specs.

Pricing for the clamshell starts at $349 and the Spin model will start at $449 in the US when the device become available in July. Acer says these devices can run for more than 13 hours on a charge.
