[Chrome Unboxed got a good find today,](https://chromeunboxed.com/asus-chromebook-flip-c436-gets-a-beautiful-new-teaser-video/) reporting on an official Asus Chromebook Flip C436 promo video. I didn't expect to see anything new in the video, considering I thought we got [all of the details on this upcoming 2-in-1 at CES back in January](https://www.aboutchromebooks.com/news/asus-chromebook-flip-c436-specifications-release-date-price-ces-2020/).

And for the most part, I was right. For the _most_ part...

Here's the video so you can see the Asus Chromebook Flip C436 in practically any angle, along with a specific mention of the [Asus-branded USI, or Universal Stylus Initiative, pen that I reported on last month](https://www.aboutchromebooks.com/news/asus-chromebook-flip-c436-manual-shows-usi-pen-that-clips-into-microsd-card-slot/).

It's around the 18 second mark where the Asus USI pen is highlighted, although you can see it in other scenes as well.

The pen will we an optional accessory sold separately and could arrive to market after the Asus Chromebook Flip C436, based on the disclaimer in the video.

Keep in mind that the official Asus pen for this 2-in-1 will magnetically attach to the microSD card slot. If you leave a memory card in your Chromebook, this won't be ideal.
