Although the $999 [Pixel Slate I bought is my full-time device](https://www.aboutchromebooks.com/news/how-to-code-on-a-chromebook-crostini-pixel-slate/), I've said more than once that most people would be better served by the $999 Google Pixelbook. And now it costs you $200 less thanks to current sale pricing on all Pixelbook models: You can nab a base Pixelbook, which is still an outstanding device, [for $799 from the Google Store](https://store.google.com/config/google_pixelbook).

If you were on the fence between a Pixelbook and Pixel Slate, I recommend [asking yourself these two questions to help you decide](https://www.aboutchromebooks.com/opinion/google-pixel-slate-vs-chromebook-should-i-buy-chromeos-tablet/).

Of course, a comparable [Pixel Slate and the Pixel Slate Keyboard](https://www.aboutchromebooks.com/reviews/google-pixel-slate-review/) will cost you $1200, which _could_ influence your decision right now; the $799 Pixelbook model has very similar hardware.

Both devices include the same 8 GB of memory and 128 GB of storage and have Intel Core i5 processors.

The Pixelbook uses a seventh-gen Intel chip while the Pixel Slate is an eighth-gen version, but I see very little performance difference between my Slate and old Pixelbook.

The only other standout variance is that the Slate has a higher resolution 3000 x 2000 display while the Pixelbook screen is still super clear at 2400 x 1600 resolution.

If you'd rather not wait for Google to deliver your on-sale Pixelbook, [Best Buy is also selling it for the same $200 off](https://www.bestbuy.com/site/google-pixelbook-12-3-touchscreen-chromebook-intel-core-i5-8gb-memory-128gb-solid-state-drive-silver/6131501.p?skuId=6131501), regardless of configuration. And as an added bonus, it will throw in a free Google Home Mini as well!
