Just a day after news of [three new low- to mid-range Chromebooks appeared](https://www.aboutchromebooks.com/news/lenovo-chromebook-s340-specifications-specs-price-estimate/), we now have some documentation suggesting that there will be another configuration of the [Lenovo Yoga Chromebook C630 with 4K display](https://www.aboutchromebooks.com/news/lenovo-yoga-chromebook-c630-with-4k-screen-debuts-at-899-99/). And this one will boost the processor as well as double the memory over the current C630.

Thanks to George who [tipped me off on Lenovo's official documentation on this new model](https://psref.lenovo.com/Detail/Lenovo%20Tablets%20&%20Convertibles/Yoga_Chromebook_C630?M=81JX000MUX), we can see the full specs, along with planned availability in the U.S. and many other countries. Here's a rundown of the configuration:

- Quad-core Core i7-8550U processor
- Integrated Intel UHD Graphics 620
- 16GB DDR4-2400 memory
- 15.6" 3840x2160 IPS glossy touch display with 300nits brightness
- 128GB eMMC 5.1 storage and microSD card reader for expansion
- 802.11ac Wi-Fi with Bluetooth 4.2
- 720p webcam
- Backlit keyboard
- 56 WHr battery

Like the aforementioned trio of new models from yesterday, there's no official press release, nor any pricing. And pricing is what I'm most interested in at this point.

Until recently, if you wanted or needed a Core i7 U-Series processor in a new Chromebook, you had a single choice: A custom configuration of the [HP Chromebook X360 14 for around $1,250](https://store.hp.com/us/en/ConfigureView?catalogId=10051&langId=-1&storeId=10151&urlLangId=&catEntryId=3074457345619122818&quantity=1). Last week, [Acer joined the super-high-end Chromebook party with its similar configuration](https://www.aboutchromebooks.com/news/acer-chromebook-spin-13-with-core-i7-16-gb-ram/), priced at $1,560.

Neither of those devices has a 4K display; in fact, the HP uses a 1080p panel. Logic dictates then that similar internal hardware in this Lenovo Yoga Chromebook C630 with a larger, higher-resolution display could put the price above $1,600, although I'm hoping that's not the case.

Of course, most people have no need for a Chromebook at these prices, nor with this kind of processing power. Unless you're a developer that wants to [use the Chrome OS build Android Studio](https://www.aboutchromebooks.com/news/android-studio-chrome-os-chromebook-recommendation-google-io-2019/) or some other programming environment and you need such power, all of these devices are overkill.
