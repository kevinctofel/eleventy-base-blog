Now that the holiday season is over, I suspect Chromebook discounts will be farther and fewer between. That's why it's worth noting that today Amazon is selling the top-end model of the [Acer Chromebook Spin 13 for $749](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07GD4CMDH/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=aboutchromebo-20&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B07GD4CMDH&linkId=f0226bd1d39c7005090c99cfad12c728) (_affiliate link_), a savings of $150 over the typical $899 price.

This is the [exact same version I tested](https://www.aboutchromebooks.com/reviews/acer-chromebook-spin-13-review-vs-pixelbook/) and was impressed by: An 8th-generation Intel Core i5 U-Series processor with Intel HD Graphics 620, 8 GB of memory, 128 GB of storage, a fantastic 2256 x 1504 resolution 13.5-inch touchscreen, backlit keyboard, a plethora of ports and the ability to flip the display behind the keyboard for various 2-in-1 scenarios.

The Acer Chromebook Spin 13 goes head to head with the larger Lenovo Yoga Chromebook C630 model that you can [get at Best Buy for $699](https://www.bestbuy.com/site/lenovo-yoga-c630-2-in-1-15-6-touch-screen-chromebook-intel-core-i5-8gb-memory-128gb-emmc-flash-memory-midnight-blue/6295998.p?skuId=6295998), but I'd be a bit leery of that, at least for now. [Lenovo says this device is "temporarily unavailable" on its own site](https://www.aboutchromebooks.com/news/lenovo-yoga-chromebook-c630-temporarily-unavailable/) and a reader who works at Best Buy says that this Chromebook is getting recalled. I haven't confirmed that yet with Lenovo but I plan to do so when I see them here at CES 2019.

Regardless, while this price doesn't beat the $699 Black Friday deal, I think this is a great Chromebook even at full price. Getting an additional $150 off is a bonus to the budget in my book.
