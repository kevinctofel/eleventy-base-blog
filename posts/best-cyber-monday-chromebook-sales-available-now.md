[Following up on Black Friday discounts](https://www.aboutchromebooks.com/news/black-friday-2019-chromebook-deals-worth-buying-for-budget-upgraders-or-new-chrome-os-users/), some of which are still available and appear below, come the Cyber Monday specials on Chromebooks. Like the list I posted for Black Friday, I'm not pointing out any deals for relatively older Chromebooks, mainly because they'll have 2.5 or fewer years of Chrome OS update support left.

And also like the list from Friday, I’ve only listed the major specifications to get you started. Click the relevant product link for additional information such as the included ports, case materials, weight, and other information.

All savings are calculated from the MSRP.

Which to buy?

If your budget allows for it, I’d probably consider either the Pixel Slate bundle first but if you’d rather not have a Chrome OS tablet — even with the included keyboard and pen.

As long as you don't mind not having a touchscreen the Asus Chromebook C425 is a great deal for the hardware; it's also $50 less than it was for Black Friday. If you do need a touchscreen, you're getting a lot of Chromebook in the Asus Chromebook 715 on the cheap as well.
