[Regular readers already knew this was coming](https://www.aboutchromebooks.com/news/how-to-use-a-non-pixel-android-phone-for-instant-tethering-on-a-chromebook-wifi-hotspot/), and now it's officially "official": You can [use a non-Pixel branded Android phone as a seamless hotspot for your Chromebook](https://blog.google/products/chromebooks/accessing-web-chromebooks-without-wi-fi-access-point/).

Once you link an Android phone to a Chromebook for tethering, the Chromebook will automatically prompt you to use your cellular data connection when a Wi-Fi network can't be found. Essentially, it's automatic and is part of [Google's Better Together branding strategy](https://www.aboutchromebooks.com/news/better-together-bringing-instant-tethering-voice-calls-and-easy-unlock-to-chromebooks/), which also includes SMS messaging and unlocking your Chrome OS device when your handset is in Bluetooth range.

Google will show a list of Chromebooks and [Android phones compatible with Instant Tethering on this help site](https://support.google.com/pixelbook/answer/7504779?hl=en), so once it's live, you can see if your devices are on the list.
