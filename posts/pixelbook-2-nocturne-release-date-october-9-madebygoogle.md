Yes, [Google is holding a hardware event in New York City on October 9](https://www.aboutchromebooks.com/news/pixelbook-2-atlas-nocturne-madebygoogle-event-october-9/). And yes, it is expected to launch [an updated Pixelbook Chromebook](https://www.aboutchromebooks.com/news/pixelbook-2-youtube-tv-ad-smaller-bezels-madebygoogle-eve-campfire/), the [Nocturne Chrome tablet](https://www.aboutchromebooks.com/news/first-look-chrome-os-pixelbook-tablet-nocturne-madebygoogle/) and new Pixel 3 and 3XL phones that day. And in the US, you'll likely be able to order at least some of the new devices that day. That's far better than hearing about new devices and having to wait a week or two before placing an order.

I found a [Google Store page](https://store.google.com/product/three) that clearly says it will have news -- suggesting there will be new devices to order -- on October 9, which is the day of the hardware event. A similar link for other regions shows October 10, which makes sense given that by the time the NYC event finishes up, it will be the next day in some places.

There are still a number of open questions about the new devices, at least on the Chromebook side of things since most of the Pixel 3 news has leaked out already.

Probably.

Does the display of Google's first Chrome OS tablet have a better resolution than the current Pixelbook? It [sounds very likely for Nocturne](https://www.aboutchromebooks.com/news/nocturne-chrome-tablet-screen-resolution-specs-pixelbook-3000x2000/), and it wouldn't surprise me if an updated Pixelbook gets a resolution boost too.

Will these products be priced closer to similar devices like the [HP Chromebook X2](https://www.aboutchromebooks.com/tag/hp-chromebook-x2/) and [Dell Insipiron 14 Chromebook](https://www.aboutchromebooks.com/news/dell-insipiron-14-chromebook-price-release-date-availability/), which start around $600? That's really the burning question at this point and the one that will have the most impact when Google Store orders begin on October 9.

Either way, if you're remotely interested in any of the new #MadeByGoogle devices, you might want to plan your budget now. With the store potentially opening up for new orders on event day, waiting could mean being stuck with an "out of stock" or "back ordered" message. I know I'll have my credit card ready - will you?
