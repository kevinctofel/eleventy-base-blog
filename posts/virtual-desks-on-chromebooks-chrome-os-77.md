I've been following the progress on a new Chrome OS feature that will [add up to four virtual desks, or workspaces, to Chromebooks](https://www.aboutchromebooks.com/news/virtual-desktop-workspaces-and-mobile-website-views-coming-to-chromebooks-and-chrome-tablets/) since November. And the latest video demonstration shows that the feature is nearly complete: You can now drag an app from one workspace to another while in overview mode.

Take a look:

While there are still occasional bug reports filed for this feature, it's definitely in the home stretch. And once it becomes available, it will be far more efficient and quicker to move your focus between groups of browser tabs and apps. Keep in mind that virtual desks are still a work in progress, so the final implementation could vary from the above video.

Unfortunately, I don't know if virtual desks will appear in Chrome OS 76 at this point. I'm running the Canary Channel of that version on a secondary device and neither the code nor the flag to enable the feature, has appeared yet.

Given that the feature freeze date for Chrome OS 76 was actually last Friday, I'm now thinking this functionality will be tied to Chrome OS 77, which won't hit the Stable Channel until September 17.

There's still a slim chance it arrives in Chrome OS 76, expected to land on August 6 for the Stable Channel, so I'll keep an eye out for it on my Canary Channel device.
