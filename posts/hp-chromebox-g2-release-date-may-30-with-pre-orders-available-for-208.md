Here come the Chromeboxes. First [Acer](https://www.aboutchromebooks.com/news/new-acer-chromebox-cxi3-models-available-for-pre-order-start-at-298/), then [Asus](https://www.aboutchromebooks.com/news/asus-chromebox-3-available-for-pre-orders-starting-at-239-and-shipping-in-mid-may/), and now HP have planned release dates and prices for the Chromeboxes they announced in January. Online pre-orders for the HP Chromebox G2 have begun at two retailers ([Tiger Direct](http://www.tigerdirect.com/applications/SearchTools/item-details.asp?EdpNo=71362) and [MacMall](http://www.macmall.com/p/HP-Inc.-Desktop-Computers/product~dpno~41171265~pdp.bdgejaac?src=search)) with HP expecting device shipments to start on or around May 30.

Like the new Chromeboxes from Acer and Asus, HP is selling a range of models that use either the older seventh-generation Intel processors or, for a higher price, the new eight-gen chips. For $208, you'll get a 1.8GHz Intel Celeron 3865U paired with 4GB of memory, 32GB of local storage with a microSD expansion option, six USB ports (with one being USB-C), HDMI out, 802.11ac with 2x2 MIMO for Wi-Fi, Bluetooth 4.2 and a Gigabit Ethernet port. That's nearly the same configuration as the base Acer unit for $30 less.

Both [Tiger Direct](http://www.tigerdirect.com/applications/SearchTools/item-details.asp?EdpNo=71405) and [MacMall](http://www.macmall.com/p/HP-Inc.-Desktop-Computers/product~dpno~41171274~pdp.bdgejabb?src=search) also have a $229 option with the same specs, so presumably, this choice would include a keyboard and mouse for the extra $20.

Moving up the budget very quickly is a $574 configuration at [both](http://www.tigerdirect.com/applications/SearchTools/item-details.asp?EdpNo=71366) [retailers](http://www.macmall.com/p/HP-Inc.-Desktop-Computers/product~dpno~41171266~pdp.bdgejaad?src=search) that has the same ports and network connectivity but is powered by a 2.6GHz seventh generation Kaby-Lake Core i5-7300 processor. For the big boost in price you also get double the memory -- 8GB of RAM -- but still 32GB of local flash storage.

And if you want the latest Intel processors inside your HP Chromebox G2, you'll pay a premium. There are two models from to choose from costing $720 ([Tiger Direct](http://www.tigerdirect.com/applications/SearchTools/item-details.asp?EdpNo=71380) / [MacMall](http://www.macmall.com/p/HP-Inc.-Desktop-Computers/product~dpno~41171269~pdp.bdgejaag?src=search)) and $820 ([Tiger Direct](http://www.tigerdirect.com/applications/SearchTools/item-details.asp?EdpNo=71392) / [MacMall](http://www.macmall.com/p/HP-Inc.-Desktop-Computers/product~dpno~41171273~pdp.bdgejaba?src=search)).

The main differences are in the chipset, storage and memory. Both are powered by a 1.9GHz eighth generation Kaby Lake-R Core i7-8650U processor. The $720 model has 8GB of memory and 32GB of storage while an extra $100 doubles both capacities: 16GB of RAM and 64GB of storage.

While HP hasn't announced these details, they generally match up with an [internal press sheet showing the HP Chromebox G2 specs](http://h20195.www2.hp.com/v2/GetPDF.aspx/c05941107). Note too that the spec sheets specifically says "Android support" even though these devices don't yet appear on the [official list of Chrome OS devices that support Android apps](https://www.chromium.org/chromium-os/chrome-os-systems-supporting-android-apps).

Email correspondence between my tipster (thanks, George!) and HP indicates that "the tentative launch date of the HP Chromebox G2 is on May 30, 2018", so if you pre-order now, you're looking at around four to five weeks, assuming HP meets its expected release date for the HP Chromebox G2.
