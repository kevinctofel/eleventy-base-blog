Last month, I shared a brief video showing the [progress of a theme switching function in Chrome OS 88](https://www.aboutchromebooks.com/news/video-look-at-the-dark-and-light-themes-coming-to-chromebooks/). The feature is currently behind an experimental flag in the Canary Channel. In just a few short weeks, there's been much progress: The latest Canary Channel version of Chrome OS looks and works much better [as shown by the below Android Police video](https://www.androidpolice.com/2020/11/13/chrome-os-is-getting-a-major-ui-revamp-with-a-new-light-theme/).

You can now switch between light and dark themes directly in the Quick Settings of Chrome OS without restarting your Chromebook. [That change only arrived a few days ago](https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/chromium/src/+/2530249) removing the need for a system restart. I'm sure that the plan was always a quick switch. Changing themes of the user interface shouldn't need you to restart a device.

And I think Google is making sure that it implements the theming functionality very carefully. [Chromebooks got a "force dark mode" feature back in Chrome OS 78 that was eventually pulled due to system crashes](https://www.reddit.com/r/chromeos/comments/dn03yf/psa_do_not_enable_force_dark_in_chromeos/).

I still say this is more a situation of Chromebooks getting a _**light**_ theme and not a dark theme though. Most of the main user interface elements in Chrome OS are already dark, save for some windowed applications such as Files, for example. It appears that Google isn't just adding the choice between two themes but it's making each of them having a more cohesive look.

Even though progress is moving quickly, don't expect to choose the light or dark side when the next major Chrome OS release arrives. This feature appears slated for Chrome OS 88, not 87, and even then it will likely be hidden behind the `chrome://flags/#dark-light-mode` experimental flag. Look for this around January 26, 2021, per the [Chromium Dash release calendar](https://chromiumdash.appspot.com/schedule).
