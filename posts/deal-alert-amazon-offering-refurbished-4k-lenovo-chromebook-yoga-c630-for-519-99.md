There haven't been too many Chromebooks on sale lately, which could be caused by what seems to be a low supply of the devices. So when searching for deals these days, I even include some refurbished Chromebooks, and today I found this one: An [Amazon Renewed Lenovo Chromebook Yoga C630 with 4K display for $519.99](https://amzn.to/2LWFEGt) plus $19.95 for shipping. Sorry, no Prime here.

That's far below the $899.99 MSRP of this 15.6-inch 2-in-1, although when you can find this model, it's typically in the $650 to $750 price range. [Lenovo currently shows a price of $769.99 direct](https://www.lenovo.com/us/en/laptops/lenovo/student-chromebooks/Yoga-Chromebook/p/88YGCC61096) but it's out of stock.

While this is a great deal in terms of savings, the Lenovo Chromebook Yoga C630 isn't for everyone. I'd say it's overkill for most Chrome OS users, in fact. For basic browsing on a smaller and lighter device, you can get what you need for $300 or so.

If you prefer a larger screen, and/or 4K resolution, and need the power of an 8th-generation Intel Core i5 U-series processor paired with 8 GB of memory though, this model is worth the look. Here's a brief rundown of the specs:

- 8th-Generation Intel Core i5-8250U processor (which uses a fan for cooling)
- Integrated Intel UHD Graphics 620
- 15.6-inch IPS touchscreen with 3840 x 2160 resolution
- 8 GB of memory
- 128 GB of eMMC storage
- Bluetooth 4.1
- 802.11ac Wi-Fi (2 x 2 MIMO)
- 720p HD camera
- 2 USB Type-C ports, 1 USB Type-A port
- MicroSD card slot
- Backlit keyboard (an upgrade from the 1080p model sold at Best Buy)

At 4.2 pounds, this isn't a Chromebook I'd want to use as a tablet nor would I want to carry around for hours on a daily basis. But an around-the-house or home office device? Weight is less of an issue in those cases.

Amazon is certifying this renewed product as "works and looks like new," and backs it with their 90-day Amazon Renewed Guarantee for either a replacement or full refund, so there's not much of a risk here if you've wanted this 4K powerhouse.
