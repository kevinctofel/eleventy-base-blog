We've had a slew of [new consumer](https://www.aboutchromebooks.com/news/acer-introduces-chromebook-spin-15-covertible-and-chromebook-15/) and [enterprise Chromebooks](https://www.aboutchromebooks.com/reviews/acer-chromebook-spin-13-review-vs-pixelbook/) arrive over the past several months from Acer and now it's time for the education market. This week at BETT, formerly known as the British Educational Training and Technology Show, in London, Acer introduced four 11.6-inch and a pair of 12-inch Chromebooks for the classroom.

Many of these devices share common features, such as U.S. MIL-STD 810G military standards compliance, multiple USB Type-C ports, IPS display options. Here are some highlights of the different models that will be made available to schools in North America and the EMEA markets starting this April. These first four models have 11.6-inch HD displays.

## Acer Chromebook 311-C721 ($279.99) and Chromebook Spin 311-R721T ($349.99)

- 7th Gen AMD A-Series A4-9120C APU with Radeon graphics
- Spill-resistant keyboards that routes spills of up to 330 ml (11 fluid ounces) of water out the bottom of the chassis.
- Moisture-resistant touchpads.

For these reasons, as well as the speed, simplicity, and security of Chrome OS, I'm not surprised that [Google made a big announcement this week at BETT](https://blog.google/outreach-initiatives/education/around-the-world-and-back/), saying there are now 80 million educators and students around the world using what has become G Suite for Education and 30 million Chromebooks in classrooms worldwide.
