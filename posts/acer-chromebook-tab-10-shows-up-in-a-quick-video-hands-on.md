We're nearing availability of the first [game-changing Chrome OS tablet](https://www.aboutchromebooks.com/opinion/why-chrome-tablets-will-be-a-game-changer/) with the [Acer Chromebook Tab 10](https://www.acer.com/ac/en/US/content/series-features/acerchromebooktab10) expected later this month. Since the device is aimed at the education market, it's been making the rounds for school administrators to see. CDW brought a Tab 10 to theÂ Indiana EdTechTeam Summit last month and one of the attendees captured this short video hands on.

There's little new to learn here in this brief look because we essentially know all of the specifications [from the official press release](https://www.acer.com/ac/en/US/content/model/NX.H0BAA.001). But at least you can see how the device's aspect ratio looks, along with the on-screen keyboard usage.

Also is a very quick look at the stylus which tucks inside the Acer Chromebook Tab 10 in the bottom right if you're holding the tablet in landscape mode. I'm not sold on that placement personally because I'd rather see the battery-free pen in the bottom of portrait mode, but that's just me.

As a reminder, Acer said to expect shipments in May for $329. Because the Chromebook Tab 10 is geared for the classroom, I don't expect to see it widely available in retail stores. Instead, you'll likely have to order online directly from Acer or a third-party reseller; some of which have already started pre-orders at a small premium.
