Aside from running this site, I actually do a weekly mobile technology podcast too. In fact, having started the [MobileTechRoundup](http://www.mobiletechroundup.com) podcast in 2004, it's one of the longest continuously running shows out there.

This weekend, Matt Miller and I did our regular show but couldn't talk about the Pixel Slate at the time. So we recorded a special edition that focuses [solely on the Pixel Slate and Pixel Slate Keyboard](https://www.aboutchromebooks.com/reviews/google-pixel-slate-review/). We both use Chrome OS devices on a regular basis -- generally full time in my case -- so our thoughts are from that perspective.

Enjoy the show!
