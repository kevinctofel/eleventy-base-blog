Let me preface this by saying that I only had my [Pixel Slate and Pixel Slate Keyboard review units](https://www.aboutchromebooks.com/reviews/google-pixel-slate-review/) for 10 minutes before I questioned how well the device would work as a laptop actually on the lap. And I let Google know about the experience: The "hinge" of the keyboard cover really needs some rigidity. Or there needs to be another magnet along the hinge that connects the keyboard to the base of the display.

To be clear, the design choice in this aspect wasn't the best.

But over time, I've simply gotten used to it. Others haven't and have returned their Pixel Slate Keyboard, opting for the [BrydgeÂ G-Type Keyboard](https://www.brydge.com/pages/gtype-keyboard-for-google-pixel-slate) as a better alternative for lap use. It's good to have choices.

Most reviewers just wrote of the Pixel Slate Keyboard, even saying in some cases that it's just not usable on your lap. After 6 hours of coding, browsing and writing yesterday using the keyboard on my lap, I disagree with such an extreme statement.

Is it perfect? Nope. Is it usable and can you be productive? Absolutely.

This is the kind of product decision that's personal, of course. So I appreciated this video look of how the Pixel Slate Keyboard works in different chairs, sitting in different ways, and even in bed. I think each individual has to make a personal choice on how well the Pixel Slate Keyboard does or doesn't work for them; and of course, there's no universally correct answer to that.

Maybe this video will help if you're on the fence about adding a Pixel Slate Keyboard to your tablet.

By the way, I found this video posted on a [new sub-Reddit devoted entirely to the Pixel Slate](https://www.reddit.com/r/pixel_slate/).

While there are certainly people there not happy with the Pixel Slate and/or the Pixel Slate Keyboard, there are also a number of folks happy with their purchase. The page is well worth following for a range of opinions, questions, and commentary that may help you decide if this Chrome OS tablet is right (or not!) for you.
