[![](images/Acer-Chromebook-Tab-10-Google-Play-Store-300x188.jpg)](https://aboutchromebooks.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Acer-Chromebook-Tab-10-Google-Play-Store.jpg)I've been doing a [weekly podcast on mobile devices](http://www.mobiletechroundup.com) since 2006 with my co-host Matthew Miller and this week, we shared some early thoughts on the upcoming [Acer Chromebook Tab 10](https://www.acer.com/ac/en/US/content/series/acerchromebooktab10). I still think [Chrome tablets will be a game changer](https://aboutchromebooks.com/opinion/why-chrome-tablets-will-be-a-game-changer/) and part of our conversation on this week's show explains why.
