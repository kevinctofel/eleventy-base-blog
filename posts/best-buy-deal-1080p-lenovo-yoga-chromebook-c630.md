A new week means there might be new Chromebook deals and sure enough, Best Buy has a good one. Their exclusive model of the Lenovo Yoga Chromebook C630 normally retails for $699.99 but is available this week for $150 off. You'll [pay $549.99 for this 2-in-1 and get a free Google Home Mini](https://www.bestbuy.com/site/lenovo-yoga-c630-2-in-1-15-6-touch-screen-chromebook-intel-core-i5-8gb-memory-128gb-emmc-flash-memory-midnight-blue/6295998.p?skuId=6295998) as well.

Since [Lenovo still isn't directly selling any 1080p models of this Chromebook](https://www.aboutchromebooks.com/news/lenovo-yoga-chromebook-c630-1080p-discontinued-us-canada/) any longer, fans of the 15.6-inch C630 don't really have another choice. Lenovo does offer a 4K version of this Chromebook and the screen is one of only two differences between it and the Best Buy model. The other is that the Best Buy version doesn't have a backlit keyboard.

Here's a rundown on the specs for this 2-in-1 Chromebook:

- 8th-Generation Intel Core i5-8250U processor (which uses a fan for cooling)
- Integrated Intel UHD Graphics 620
- 15.6-inch 1920 x 1080 IPS touch panel
- 8 GB of memory
- 128 GB of eMMC storage
- Bluetooth 4.1
- 802.11ac Wi-Fi (2 x 2 MIMO)
- 720p HD camera
- 2 USB Type-C ports, 1 USB Type-A port
- MicroSD card slot

Currently, [Lenovo is discounting the Yoga Chromebook C630 with 4K display](https://www.lenovo.com/us/en/laptops/yoga/yoga-c-series/Yoga-Chromebook/p/88YGCC61096) down to just under $713. Are the higher resolution and backlit keyboard worth the price difference?

That's a personal choice. I could certainly live without a 4K display but I'm pretty partial to having backlit keys. It's also worth noting that some C630 owners that bought the Best Buy model have reported backlight bleeding on the screen, so you may want to check out this model in person before making any purchase decisions.

On the plus side, you'll get more battery life out of the 1080p model, so that may be a factor worth considering as well.
