With the continuing removal of the 3.5-millimeter headphone jack on mobile devices -- I'm looking at you [Pixel Slate](https://www.aboutchromebooks.com/reviews/google-pixel-slate-review/) -- I've generally migrated away from wired headphones. My main cans are the [Sony MDR-1000X noise-canceling headphones](https://www.sony.com/electronics/headband-headphones/mdr-1000x) -- there have been two updated models made since I bought them --  and I run daily with AirPods connected to an Apple Watch 3.

Last night I used the Sonys to catch some college football on the Pixel Slate and while it wasn't difficult to pair them, it's going to get easier next year. [Google will sync Bluetooth pairing data through a Google account, even on Chromebooks](https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2018/11/fast-pair-update.html).

The feature, known as Fast Pair, is similar to how Apple implements Bluetooth pairing across macOS and iOS devices: Pair with one device and any other devices using the same account will effectively auto-pair with all of them. [Fast Pair was introduced last year for phones running Android 6.0 or better](https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2017/10/announcing-fast-pair-effortless.html) but didn't have this synchronization feature.

It makes complete sense that Chromebooks will be supported since they too are tied to a Google account. Fast Pair is implemented within Android and most Chromebooks today -- every new one since 2017 -- run the Android subsystem so I wouldn't expect Google to drag their feet with this feature update; it should be relatively easy to add within the Android container on Chrome OS.

By the way, although many reviewers are lamenting the fact that the Pixel Slate doesn't have a headphone jack, Google does include a USB-C to 3.5-millimeter dongle with the Slate.

I don't think dongles are the ideal solution for such a design decision, but at least it helps with the transition if you're still all in on wired headphones. There are also two USB Type-C ports, so you can still charge the Slate or use other USB-C devices with it while listening to music. And if you need or want USB-C headphones, the ones that come with the Pixel 3 are actually pretty decent; you can [order them directly from Google for $30](https://store.google.com/product/usb_c_earbuds) if you want your own pair and don't have a Pixel phone.
