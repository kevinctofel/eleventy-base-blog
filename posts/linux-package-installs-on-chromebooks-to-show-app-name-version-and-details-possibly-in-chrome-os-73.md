Back in September, I pointed out a Chrome OS bug report that had planned to provide [more detailed information on a Linux application before actually installing it on a Chromebook](https://www.aboutchromebooks.com/news/chrome-os-will-show-debian-package-details-when-installing-in-the-files-app/). Work has continued on that effort and I recently captured a screenshot to show how it will look in Chrome OS:

[![](images/crostini-app-install-details-e1550491003423.png)](https://www.aboutchromebooks.com/news/linux-package-installs-on-chromebooks-to-show-app-name-version-and-details-possibly-in-chrome-os-73/attachment/crostini-app-install-details/)

This screenshot isn't from my Pixel Slate; the feature hasn't been released yet so I don't have access to it. Instead, this is a work-in-progress capture from the Chromium team as the functionality continues to develop.

As a result, the final implementation _could_ look different. But I'm pretty doubtful that much if anything will change from this image. The original feature description was to add "a details pane in the file managerâ€™s .deb install dialog to provide package name, version, and a description of the package," which is exactly what this dialog box provides.

The idea here is that when using the native Files app to install a Debian package -- essentially a Linux app -- users will know more about what it is they're actually installing before they click that Install button, making the experience a little more user-friendly and informative.

I'll be watching for this feature in the next release of the Chrome OS 73 Dev Channel since there's a feature freeze date on February 22 for this version. If the dialog box doesn't make the cut, look for this addition in Chrome OS 74.
