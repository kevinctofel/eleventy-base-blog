The HP Chromebook X360 is discounted from its $599 price from time to time and this week is one of those times. All week long you can [pick up the HP Chromebook X360 from Best Buy for $449.00](https://www.bestbuy.com/site/hp-2-in-1-14-touch-screen-chromebook-intel-core-i3-8gb-memory-64gb-emmc-flash-memory-white/6301869.p?skuId=6301869) and save yourself $150 from the typical retail price.

I haven't used this 2-in-1 Chromebook, but I have used the [HP Chromebook X2](https://www.aboutchromebooks.com/news/hp-chromebook-x2-arrives-as-the-first-detachable-chromebook-tablet/) with detachable display, which the X360 design borrows heavily from. And the X2 was a fantastic device in general during my time with it; the only reason I returned it is because I thought it might be a little under-powered for my expected usage.

The [HP Chromebook X360](https://www.aboutchromebooks.com/news/hp-chromebook-x360-release-date-price-specs/) doesn't have a removable screen like the X2, nor does it have a stylus, but it has an improved processor, double the memory and roughly 30-percent more battery life than the X2.

Here's what you get: An 8th-gen [Intel Core i3-8130U](https://ark.intel.com/products/137977/Intel-Core-i3-8130U-Processor-4M-Cache-up-to-3-40-GHz-)Â with a 2.2 GHz base frequency, turbo-boost up to 4GHz; a 14-inch full HD touch display with thin bezels on the sides, 8GB of memory, 64GB of eMMC storage, 802.11ac Wi-Fi and Bluetooth. There are a pair of USB Type-C ports and one Type-A, plus a headphone/microphone jack and microSD card reader. HP says to expect 13.5 hours of run-time per charge.

Note that the X2 used an 7th-gen Intel Core m3 Y-series CPU, so the X360 has a newer processor. And because the chip is a U-Series model, it can run longer at full capacity unlike the older m3. The one possible downside? U-Series chips require fans to reduce the heat produced during those heavy-duty CPU cycles, so the HP Chromebook X360 does have a fan.

Regardless, this is a top-notch 2-in-1 with few flaws and an enough performance for all but high-end power users of Chrome OS. Don't take my word for it though: Check Robbie's detailed video review from Chrome Unboxed below.
