Still looking for a family member gift or just want a new Chromebook and smart device for yourself? I have your back, thanks to a little help from Lenovo. Between today and next Sunday, you can enter the About Chromebooks Holiday Giveaway and win them both!One randomly chosen entry will receive both [a Lenovo IdeaPad 5 Chromebook](https://www.lenovo.com/us/en/p/laptops/lenovo/lenovo-edu-chromebooks/5i-chromebook-gen-6-(14-intel)/wmd00000481) and a [Lenovo Smart Clock 2](https://www.lenovo.com/us/en/p/smart-devices/smart-home/smart-home-series/smart-clock-gen-2/wmd00000485), which is a nice little bundle.

I've never used a Smart Clock 2, but it looks handy near a bedside.

However, I have [used and reviewed this Chromebook](https://www.aboutchromebooks.com/news/lenovo-ideapad-5i-chromebook-review-a-potent-pentium-powered-laptop/), finding it offers surprisingly performance for the configuration. Yes, that newest Intel Pentium Gold 7505 is some capable silicon.

Indeed, in my review, I said:

> This is definitely more of a mid-range performer, even with the 4 GB of RAM, that should suit most Chromebook user’s needs. As I mentioned earlier, the Lenovo IdeaPad Chromebook 5 is a definite contender for “Chromebook of the year” based on the price and performance.

All you have to do to enter is provide your email address. I’m not collecting any user data and your email address will only be used to contact the winner. Note that that is contest is only open to U.S. residents (sorry!), so the winner will have to provide a mailing address in the U.S. You can only enter one time, so once you've done so, there's no need to revisit this page or fill out another entry form.

Even if you don't win, this is as good a time as any to say thanks for all the reader support in 2020 and that I hope you have a great holiday season!
