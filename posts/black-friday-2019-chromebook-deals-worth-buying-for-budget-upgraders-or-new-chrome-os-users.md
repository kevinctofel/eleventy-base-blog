It's been an exciting 2019 for Chromebooks as we've passed the [10th anniversary of Chrome OS](https://www.aboutchromebooks.com/news/chrome-os-is-10-years-old-heres-the-first-demo-from-2009/) and have a broad range of devices to choose from. And if you've waited to get your first Chromebook or you're upgrading an older one, Black Friday sales are your best bet for a great deal.

Here's a roundup of some of the better deals that have at least four more years of [Chrome OS software update support](https://www.aboutchromebooks.com/news/chrome-os-software-support-dates-extended-for-more-than-130-chromebooks/). I've skipped any deals on Chromebooks that have internal hardware that's just too old or don't have enough remaining software support in my opinion.

To keep this list somewhat concise, I've only listed the major specifications to get you started. Click the relevant product link for additional information such as the included ports, case materials, weight, and other information.

All savings are calculated from the MSRP.

Which to buy?

If your budget allows for it, I'd probably consider either the Pixel Slate bundle first but if you'd rather not have a Chrome OS tablet -- even with the included keyboard and pen -- I think the HP Chromebook X360 14 is a stellar deal as well, with the larger Acer Chromebook 715 closely behind.

The Asus Chromebook C425 isn't a bad pick either but lacks a touchscreen. The other models aren't bad, and most are less expensive, however, they are a bit older and don't have the performance and power of my recommended trio.
