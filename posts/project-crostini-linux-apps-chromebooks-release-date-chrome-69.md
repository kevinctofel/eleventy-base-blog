If you were waiting for [Project Crostini to move past the Dev Channel](https://www.aboutchromebooks.com/tag/crostini/), you're going to be waiting a little longer. Google has decided to hold the feature, which lets you run full Linux apps in a container, [to Chrome 69 for both the Beta and Stable Channels](https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/chromium/src/+/1101741).

The code commit noting the change was [spotted by Reddit user chidoelray on Tuesday](https://www.reddit.com/r/Crostini/comments/8s8qq9/psa_stay_on_the_dev_channel_if_you_use_crostini/) and there's no misinterpreting it:

> We want to release to dev/canary for version 67 and 68 and to release to all chanels\[sic\] since version 69. The beta/stable release is pushed back from 68 to 69.

So what does that mean as far as timing?

If you plan to stay on either the Beta or Stable Channel of Chrome OS, you're likely looking at August or September. There's an [estimated release date calendar for the year here](https://www.chromium.org/developers/calendar), but remember, these are just estimated dates.

Obviously, the Dev Channel will continue to have access to Project Crostini. That's the environment where folks can kick the tires and report bugs. So if you're using Linux apps on your Chrome OS device, you can still do so. Or if you want to try them, you can [switch to the Dev Channel](https://www.aboutchromebooks.com/qa/whats-the-difference-between-developer-mode-and-the-dev-channel-on-a-chromebook/).
