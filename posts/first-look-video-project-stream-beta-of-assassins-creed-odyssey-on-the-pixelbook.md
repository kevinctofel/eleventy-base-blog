I got into the [Project Stream beta](https://blog.google/technology/developers/pushing-limits-streaming-technology/) over the weekend and finally got a chance to try it. If you're not familiar with Project Stream, it's a [Google effort to bring video game streaming to the Chrome browser](https://www.aboutchromebooks.com/news/assassins-creed-odyssey-play-chromebook-in-1080p-project-stream/). Of course, that means any Chromebook should be supported since the cloud is doing the heavy lifting.

I thought my Xbox controller would work -- as you'll see in the video -- but it turns out I don't have the right one. As a result, I had to use my keyboard, which is not ideal. At least not for me, anyway.

Overall, this looks very promising as long as you have a 25 Mbps or better internet connection. Frame rates looks pretty good as did the 1080p video quality. Input lag could use some improvement but again: This is a beta. My hope is that Google improves that in the coming months so the Chromebook becomes even more of a Swiss Army knife: A desktop browsing machine that runs Android apps, [Linux apps](https://www.aboutchromebooks.com/tag/project-crostini), and dual boots into Windows 10 for those that need it. Adding a streaming console game experience would be icing on the cake.
