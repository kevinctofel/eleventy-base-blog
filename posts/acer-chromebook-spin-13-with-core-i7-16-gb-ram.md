The Acer Chromebook Spin 13 is still one of my favorite 2-in-1 Chromebooks, [perhaps even more so than the Google Pixelbook](https://www.aboutchromebooks.com/reviews/acer-chromebook-spin-13-review-vs-pixelbook/). And if you're looking for a high-powered version beyond the Core i5 model, Acer now has one. The [Acer Chromebook Spin 13 can be had with an Intel Core i7-8550U processor and 16 GB of RAM](https://www.acer.com/ac/en/US/content/professional-model/NX.EFJAA.010).

The price seems a tad high to me, however. Full retail price is $1,569.99. And if you didn't already know, there's been a Chromebook option with a _slightly_ faster Core i7-8650U chip: The HP Chromebook X360 14 can be configured with such a beast. And as of this moment, [that model is priced at $1,248.87 direct from HP](https://store.hp.com/us/en/ConfigureView?catalogId=10051&langId=-1&storeId=10151&urlLangId=&catEntryId=3074457345619122818&quantity=1).

Both devices are equipped with the same 16 GB of memory while the Acer option doubles up on the local storage: 128 GB vs 64 on the HP. The Acer's 2256 x 1504 display resolution is higher than the 1920 x 1080 on the HP option as well. Even so, those differences are worth the $300 premium.

Clearly, most people **_don't_** need to spend this much on a Chromebook, nor do they need a Core i7 processor and 16 GB of memory for basic Chromebook use.

Truth be told, however, I've been thinking about a replacement for my Core i5 Pixel Slate and if I do make the switch it will likely to be a Core i7 device.

Don't misunderstand me: I love the Pixel Slate. It's still my daily driver and has been since I ordered it last fall. However, I started considering an upgrade when [Google listed its recommended devices for Android Studio](https://www.aboutchromebooks.com/news/android-studio-chrome-os-chromebook-recommendation-google-io-2019/) and all of them had U-Series processors compared to the less powerful Y-Series chips found in the Pixel Slate.

For day-to-day [Java and Python coding in my CompSci classes, the Slate has been a champ](https://www.aboutchromebooks.com/news/how-to-code-on-a-chromebook-crostini-pixel-slate/). Then again, my homework assignments and class projects are relatively small: Very few apps are more than four or five hundred lines of code. Once I move on to development outside of class - likely for Android apps - I think the Slate may be overwhelmed by Android Studio, numerous libraries and frameworks, and much larger codebases.

Implementing a linked list stack in Java on the Pixel Slate - yay!

I'm still on the fence because for now, the Slate is fine. But I am trying to think ahead on some projects I've been planning.

As much as I like the Acer Chromebook Spin 13, nearly $1,600 for the new high-end model is a big stretch when that HP Chromebook X360 14 can probably fit the bill for $300 less.

Regardless, there are now two good options in the "super-powered" Chromebook space so if you're computing requirements are similar to mine, you've got a pair of choices to consider.
