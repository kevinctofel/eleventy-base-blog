There are a number of Chromebooks on sale for today's Amazon Prime Day event, [including $100 off the Asus Chromebook Flip C302](https://www.aboutchromebooks.com/news/deal-amazon-selling-asus-flip-c302-for-449-99-50-off/). Now I see that the [Google Pixelbook is also reduced in price: You can grab the base model for $749 today](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B075JSK7TR/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=aboutchromebo-20&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B075JSK7TR&linkId=c750e5452882b4e982af260d2767ac16) (_affiliate link_).

The normal price of this base Pixelbook is $999, so you're getting a $250 discount for what's considered by many to be a flagship Chromebook. It runs on an seventh-generation Intel Core i5 processor, has 8 GB of memory (more than enough for running [Linux apps using Project Crostini](https://www.aboutchromebooks.com/tag/project-crostini)), 128 GB of local storage and a 2400 x 1600 touchscreen display. You can fold that display back 360-degrees to use the Pixelbook in tablet mode. The Pixelbook also supports stylus input, but you'll pay extra for that pen.

 

Should you buy it? That's a personal choice of course but the device is outstanding. Still, I've found that the HP Chromebook X2 gets you nearly the same performance but with the additional benefit of a detachable display for much less: This week, [Best Buy is selling the X2 with a $30 discount for a final price of $569.99](https://www.aboutchromebooks.com/news/hp-chromebook-x2-sale-for-569-99-at-best-buy/).

And of course, there are plenty of other high-end Chromebooks in the pipeline. [Acer announced its Spin 13 with next-gen Intel chips, for example, last month](https://www.aboutchromebooks.com/news/new-acer-chromebook-spin-13-chromebook-13-launching-at-acer-next-event/) and I expect to see the product available in roughly two months. We don't yet have a price on that model though. There's also a [Qualcomm Snapdragon 845-powered Chromebook, known internally as "Cheza" in the works](https://www.aboutchromebooks.com/news/cheza-lte-chromebook-detachable-snapdragon-845/) as well as a [4K Chromebook with detachable screen that's code-named "Atlas"](https://www.aboutchromebooks.com/news/more-evidence-suggests-atlas-is-a-4k-detachable-chromebook-tablet/).

If you can't wait for these or don't want integrated LTE (which Cheza is likely to have), buying a discounted Pixelbook now may be the way to go if your budget can handle it.
