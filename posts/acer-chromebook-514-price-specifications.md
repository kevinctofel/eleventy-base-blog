After [announcing the Acer Chromebook 514 back in August](https://www.aboutchromebooks.com/news/acer-chromebook-514-is-a-14-inch-laptop-with-gorilla-glass-trackpad-starting-at-349/) and then [seeing the device certified by the FCC in October](https://www.aboutchromebooks.com/news/acer-chromebook-cb-514-specs-release-date-october/), I expected sales to begin in November. We're now in December and you still can't buy this Chrome OS laptop, but at least the [Acer Chromebook 514 product page](https://www.acer.com/ac/en/US/content/series/acerchromebook514) is live in the US.

There's only [one model shown currently and it has a price of $499.99](https://www.acer.com/ac/en/US/content/model/NX.H1LAA.003), which is higher than expected, although Acer was coy on device specs a few months ago. I suspect we'll see a few different configurations soon. The Pentium chip inside the 514 launched in 2016, so this device doesn't have the latest CPU or integrated GPU technology.

Here's a listing of the hardware specs you get for that price:

- [Intel Pentium N4200](https://ark.intel.com/products/95592/Intel-Pentium-Processor-N4200-2M-Cache-up-to-2-5-GHz-) quad-core processor with 1.1 GHz base clock speed, 2.5 GHz turbo speed
- 8 GB of LPDDR4 memory
- 64 GB of eMMC storage
- A 14 inch IPS touchscreen display with 1920 x 1080 resolution
- Backlit keyboard and HDR camera for video chat
- Intel UHD Graphics 505 with that shares memory with the system
- 802.11ac Wi-Fi (no mention of Bluetooth but I would expect it there)
- A pair of USB Type-C (USB 3.1) and two USB Type-A (USB 3.0) ports, a headphone jack, microphone and stereo speakers
- Battery life expectations of up to 12 hours
- Weight of 3.31 pounds

Like the [Acer Chromebook Spin 13 I recently reviewed](https://www.aboutchromebooks.com/reviews/acer-chromebook-spin-13-review-vs-pixelbook/) the Acer Chromebook 514 has an aluminum chassis and a Gorilla Glass trackpad. This Chromebooks is not a 2-in-1 like the Spin13, however. It's also not as powerful, which is to be expected since it's $400 less than the Spin configuration I used: You're getting a Pentium chip here instead of a Core i5.

If Acer does have a Chromebook 514 priced at $349.99 -- which is the starting price the company announced in August -- I'd expect that model to have a Celeron processor and 4 GB of memory; possibly even 32 GB of storage. More information on availability to follow as soon as I have it; thanks Mike for the tip!
