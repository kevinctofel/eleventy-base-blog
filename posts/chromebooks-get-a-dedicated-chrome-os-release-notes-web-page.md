When I worked at Google back in 2016 and 2017, I occasionally pushed for Chrome OS release notes but the requests mostly fell on deaf ears. It seems it was only a matter of time though because [Chromebooks now have a dedicated page for high-level release notes, which you can find here](https://www.google.com/chromebook/whatsnew/embedded/).

Dinsan Francis [first spotted this upcoming feature](https://www.chromestory.com/2019/06/chrome-os-to-get-release-notes-app-pwa/) and shared it on his Chrome Story blog back in June. [Today he reports that the page is live](https://www.chromestory.com/2019/08/first-look-at-chrome-os-release-notes-its-a-web-page/).

Like Dinsan, I think this is more of a high-level overview of new features or functions as opposed to a true list of release notes. But I can see why Google is taking this approach: It fits in with the "simplicity" of Chrome OS. Bogging mainstream users down with detailed code minutia is the exact _opposite_ of simplicity.

I assume this release notes web page will be updated with every new Chrome OS release; we should find out shortly since [Chrome OS 76](https://www.aboutchromebooks.com/tag/chrome-os-76/) should hit the Stable Channel any day now. Indeed, the current release notes mention some, but not all of the features I'm expecting:

- [Virtual Desks (here's a video demo)](https://www.aboutchromebooks.com/news/chrome-os-77-first-look-at-virtual-desks-video-chromebook/)
- [Disabling the Crostini backup and restore feature](https://www.aboutchromebooks.com/news/chrome-os-76-will-disable-crostini-linux-backups-by-default/) by default
- ["Send to Self"](https://www.aboutchromebooks.com/news/chrome-os-76-adds-send-to-self-feature-for-pushing-web-pages-to-your-other-devices/)
- [Improved tab visuals](https://www.aboutchromebooks.com/news/chrome-os-76-improves-tab-information-visuals-on-chromebooks/)

Although you could bookmark the release notes page, you don't have to. Disnan reports that a "See what's new" option will be added to the "About Chrome OS" settings.

What do you think: Are these high-level notes good enough or would you rather see more from Google with each new Chrome OS release?
