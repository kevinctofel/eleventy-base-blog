[Samsung is already sharing some of its Black Friday deals](https://www.samsung.com/us/shop/early-black-friday/), which start on November 18 and all of its mid-range ChromebookÂ models are discounted. Sure there are some new higher-end Chromebooks, like the [Acer Chromebook Spin 13](https://www.aboutchromebooks.com/reviews/acer-chromebook-spin-13-review-vs-pixelbook/) and the [Google Pixel Slate](https://www.aboutchromebooks.com/opinion/which-google-pixel-slate-to-buy-guide/) as options, but those are all starting at $599. With the Black Friday deal, Samsung's latest Chromebooks start as low as $349.99.

Here are the four options I'm seeing now on Samsung's Black Friday site:

- $349.99: [Samsung Chromebook Plus v2](https://www.samsung.com/us/computing/chromebooks/12-14/samsung-chromebook-plus-xe520qab-k01us/) with Intel Celeron 3965Y, 4 GB of RAM and 32GB of storage ($150 savings)
- $449.99: [Samsung Chromebook Plus v2](https://www.samsung.com/us/computing/chromebooks/12-14/samsung-chromebook-plus-xe520qab-k02us/) with Intel Core m3 7Y30, 4GB of RAM and 64GB of storage ($150 savings)
- $499.99: [Samsung Chromebook Pro](https://www.samsung.com/us/computing/chromebooks/12-14/samsung-chromebook-pro-xe510c24-k01us) with Intel Core m3 6Y30, 4GB of RAM and 32GB of storage ($100 savings)
- $499.99: [Samsung Chromebook Pro with](https://www.samsung.com/us/computing/chromebooks/12-14/samsung-chromebook-pro-xe510c25-k01us/) a backlit keyboard, Intel Core m3 6Y30, 4GB of RAM and 32GB of storage ($100 savings)

If your heart is settled on the Pro, then it's almost a no-brainer to get the backlit model. But it _may_ make sense to consider the Plus V2 for $50 less, which gets you slightly better internals than the Pro model. Aside from doubling up on your local storage, the Plus v2 uses a 7th-generation Core m3 processor while the Plus models use the 6th-gen chip.

None of these models have integrated LTE and one other key difference between the Plus and Pro devices is the screen resolution; you'll get a 2400 x 1600 touch display for the Pro, while the Plus v2 uses a 1920 x 1080 screen.

Thanks to Eric for the tip; Eric notes that if you're a college student, you can get an even larger discount on the Core m3 powered Chromebook Plus v2 through [Unidays](https://www.myunidays.com/US/en-US)!
