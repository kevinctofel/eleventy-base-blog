There are a few Amazon Prime Day deals available today that I'll surface over the next 48 hours and the first one is a whopper of a discount.

You can snag a powerful configuration of the [Acer Chromebook Spin 13 for $599.99](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07GD4CMDH/ref=gbdp_vlo_3607b8ae_B07GD4CMDH?_encoding=UTF8&smid=ATVPDKIKX0DER), which is $300 less than for what Acer sells it at directly.

This is the [same Acer Chromebook Spin 13 model I reviewed last year](https://www.aboutchromebooks.com/reviews/acer-chromebook-spin-13-review-vs-pixelbook/) but with _double_ the local storage, and I found it to perform even better than the similarly equipped Google Pixelbook.

Plus it comes with a digital stylus; that's a $99 option for the Pixelbook.

Here's a rundown of the specs:

- Intel Core i5-8250U quad-core processor with 1.60 GHz clock speed
- 8 GB of LPDDR3 memory
- 128 GB of eMMC storage
- A 13.5 inch IPS touchscreen display with 2256 x 1504 resolution and 3:2 aspect ratio
- Intel UHD Graphics 620 with that shares memory with the system
- 360-degree hinge for 2-in-1 usage in tent, display and tablet modes
- An EMR pen that is stowed inside the Chromebook
- 802.11ac Wi-Fi (2×2 MIMO) and Bluetooth 4.2
- A pair of USB Type-C (USB 3.1, Gen 1) ports, a USB Type-A (USB 3.0) port, a microSD card reader, headphone jack, microphone and stereo speakers
- Battery life expectations of up to 10 hours

I still use an Acer Chromebook Spin 13 as a device for testing alongside the Pixel Slate that I bought. When I need more power and performance though - say for heavy-duty coding - I turn to the Acer.

In addition to the power it brings, thanks to [the U-series processor which is recommended for Android Studio](https://www.aboutchromebooks.com/news/android-studio-chrome-os-chromebook-recommendation-google-io-2019/), this Chromebook has a fantastic display, trackpad, and keyboard. Battery life too is excellent as I've always been able to get through a full 9 hours of usage; often with a charge to spare.

The only nit I have with this device is that the bottom-firing speakers are a bit lacking. Otherwise, this is a high-end Chromebook that gets the job done well, no matter what the job is.

[This is a one-day deal](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07GD4CMDH/ref=gbdp_vlo_3607b8ae_B07GD4CMDH?_encoding=UTF8&smid=ATVPDKIKX0DER), so don't wait on it if it sounds good to you.
