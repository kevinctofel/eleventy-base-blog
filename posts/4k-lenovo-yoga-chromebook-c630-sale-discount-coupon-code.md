The [4K edition of Lenovo's Yoga Chromebook C630 saw a 10 percent discount over Super Bowl weekend](https://www.aboutchromebooks.com/news/super-bowl-savings-10-percent-off-the-4k-lenovo-yoga-chromebook-c630/) and now it can be had for even less. Lenovo is stacking a pair of discounts on this 2-in-1 with 4K display bringing the price down to $629.99 from its $899.99 list price.

The company has [a $200 instant savings deal along with an _additional_ 10 percent coupon code of PRESIDENT10](https://www.lenovo.com/us/en/laptops/yoga/yoga-c-series/Yoga-Chromebook/p/88YGCC61096), dropping the cost a whopping $270 from MSRP.

This is the top configuration available for the Lenovo Yoga Chromebook C630, with the following specs:

- 8th-Generation Intel Core i5-8250U processor (which uses a fan for cooling)
- Integrated Intel UHD Graphics 620
- 15.6-inch 3840 x 2160 IPS touch panel
- 8 GB of memory
- 128 GB of eMMC storage
- Bluetooth 4.1
- 802.11ac Wi-Fi (2 x 2 MIMO)
- 720p HD camera
- 2 USB Type-C ports, 1 USB Type-A port
- MicroSD card slot
- Backlit keyboard

Keep in mind that if you decide to splurge on the 4K model, it won't ship until 4 or 5 weeks out, according to Lenovo.

And that 4K edition will have less battery life than the 1080p model, which is also on sale, [based on Laptop Magazine's benchmark tests](https://www.laptopmag.com/reviews/laptops/lenovo-yoga-chromebook-c630-4k): They saw just under 7 hours of run time when continuously surfing the web with the display brightness of 150 nits. By comparison, my [Pixel Slate and it's 3000 x 2000 resolution display](https://www.aboutchromebooks.com/reviews/google-pixel-slate-review/) got nearly 10 hours of run time in the same test.
