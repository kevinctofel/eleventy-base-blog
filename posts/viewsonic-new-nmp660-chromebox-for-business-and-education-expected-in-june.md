Back in March, [Viewsonic announced its first Chromebox, the NMP660](https://www.viewsonic.com/us/news/viewsonic-launches-its-chromebox-that-delivers-an-all-in-one-education-signage-and-enterprise-cloud-management-solution), would launch in April. Well, April came and went, so what happened? According to an email conversation with Viewsonic, the new Chromebox is pushed back to late June, although you can now [special order one online from a third-party vendor](https://www.antarespro.com/11810137-item-VIEWSONIC-NMP660-766907970517.aspx?sgd=330d315d319d317d316).

Viewsonic is targeting both the education and enterprise sectors for the [NMP660 Chromebox](https://www.viewsonic.com/us/nmp660.html), which will support Google Play Store for Android apps. I could see schools using these for a teacher desktop setup, along with classroom presentations.

And enterprises could easily add video-conference gear or attach the NMP660 to a monitor for digital signage.

MSRP is expected to be $350 for the device which is powered by a 1.8GHz Intel Kaby Lake 3865U paired with 4GB of memory and 32GB of on-board SSD storage. Support for 802.11ac Wi-Fi, Bluetooth 4.2, and Gigabit Ethernet are also part of the package.

Like all Chrome OS devices, school or business IT admins can easily [deploy and manage the NMP660 through the Google Management Console](https://support.google.com/chrome/a/answer/1289314?hl=en) which allows more than 200 configurable policies from within a web browser.
