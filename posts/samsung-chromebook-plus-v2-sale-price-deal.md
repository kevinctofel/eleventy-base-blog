With the holiday season over, Chromebook sales seem to have become farther and fewer between. Today, however, you can you pick up either the Celeron version of the [Samsung Chromebook Plus v2 for $399.99](https://amzn.to/2Wsq60X) or the [Core m3 option for $499.99](https://amzn.to/2Ul70YM) (_affiliate links_), which is $100 off the regular prices.

At this cost, you'd be hard pressed to find a 2-in-1 Chromebook with both a full HD touchscreen and stylus input. These are [both the refreshed version 2 models that launched back last summer](https://www.aboutchromebooks.com/news/samsung-chromebook-plus-v2-release-date-price/), but they're still quite capable and a good value at this price.

Each has a 12.2-inch 1920 x 1080 1200 touch screen, the included stylus, a pair of USB Type-C ports, one USB Type-A port, a 720p front camera, a 13-megapixel "world view" camera when in tablet mode, microSD card slot.

The only difference between the two is that the $399.99 model uses an [Intel Celeron 3965Y](https://ark.intel.com/products/122698/Intel-Celeron-Processor-3965Y-2M-Cache-1_50-GHz) with 4 GB of memory and 32 GB of storage, while the more expensive version opts for an [Intel Core m3 7Y30](https://ark.intel.com/products/95449/Intel-Core-m3-7Y30-Processor-4M-Cache-2-60-GHz-) chip with the same RAM capacity but 64 GB of storage. Both also use the integrated [Intel HD Graphics 615](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/products/96554/graphics-drivers/graphics-for-7th-generation-intel-processors/intel-hd-graphics-615.html), which is capable of running an external display at 4K resolution with 60 frames per second over a Display Port cable.

While the latest Chromebooks use Intel's 8th-generation chips the Samsung Chromebook Plus v2 is still snappy with a 7-th gen processor. It supports both the Google Play Store for Android apps and [Linux apps through Project Crostini](https://www.aboutchromebooks.com/tag/project-crostini/).

At these prices, either is a good 2-in-1 choice for students and those new to Chromebooks who don't need traditional desktop apps for Windows or macOS.
