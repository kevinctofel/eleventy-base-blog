Here in the U.S., you still can't buy an [Asus Chromebook Flip C536](https://www.aboutchromebooks.com/news/you-can-now-buy-the-asus-chromebook-flip-c536-cx5/) (aka CX5) directly from Asus. However, [Best Buy does sell this 15.6-inch Chromebook](https://www.bestbuy.com/site/asus-2-in-1-15-6-touch-screen-chromebook-intel-core-11th-gen-i3-8gb-memory-128gb-ssd-matte-white-matte-white/6449514.p?skuId=6449514), which is normally priced at $569. That's reasonable for what you get but this $100 sale makes the deal even sweeter for [an 11th-gen Core i3 convertible Chromebook at $469](https://www.bestbuy.com/site/asus-2-in-1-15-6-touch-screen-chromebook-intel-core-11th-gen-i3-8gb-memory-128gb-ssd-matte-white-matte-white/6449514.p?skuId=6449514).

This actually might be the best value on the market, at least while the sale is in effect. Aside from the 1080p resolution 15.6-inch touchscreen, you're getting that 11th-gen Core i3 paired with 8 GB of memory and 128 GB of speedy SSD storage.

I've seen some recent entry-level Chromebooks with half the RAM and storage approaching $400, for example. Oh and those typically have either a Celeron or Pentium processor, which would be a few steps behind in the performance department.

Obviously, you have to want a large display over a smaller, more portable laptop. The [Asus Chromebook Flip C536](https://www.asus.com/us/Laptops/For-Work/Chromebook/ASUS-Chromebook-Flip-C536/) weighs a tad over 4 pounds. But of course, a device with that size and weight allows for a roomier chassis to fit a full backlit keyboard and numeric keypad, a relatively massive glass trackpad measuring 5.68-inches diagonally, and plenty of ports.

Unfortunately, Asus _didn't_ include as many ports as I think it could have.

You'll have to make do with a pair of USB Type-C and one Type-A, plus an HDMI output and microphone/headphone combo jack. That's actually not too bad, but another Type-A would have been sweet! WiFi 6 and Bluetooth 5.0 round out the connectivity options and you also get a webcam for video calls.

Overall, Asus is delivering a relatively nice design, a solid large touchscreen display with slim bezels and performance capabilities for most of the market with its Asus Chromebook Flip C536.

If you want a larger device with those features, I'm not sure you can get a better one for under $500 during this sale.

_**Update**: This deal was originally available and posted on July 13. It's currently back as of today._
