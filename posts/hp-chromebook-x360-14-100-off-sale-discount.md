I'm surely not the only one who spends early Sunday mornings surfing weekly ads over coffee. If you're not one of those people though, you will have missed [a $100 sale on the HP Chromebook X360 14 at Best Buy](https://www.bestbuy.com/site/hp-2-in-1-14-touch-screen-chromebook-intel-core-i3-8gb-memory-64gb-emmc-flash-memory-hp-finish-in-ceramic-white-and-cloud-blue/6301869.p?skuId=6301869): This 2-in-1 Chromebook is priced at $499 this week and you'll also get a Google Home Mini with purchase.

[HP debuted this convertible back in October with this very model](https://www.aboutchromebooks.com/news/hp-chromebook-x360-release-date-price-specs/), which is the base configuration. If you want a Core i5, Core i7, or other changes, you'll have to hit [HP's store to choose your options](https://store.hp.com/us/en/ConfigureView?catalogId=10051&langId=-1&storeId=10151&urlLangId=&catEntryId=3074457345619122818&quantity=1), which of course will significantly bump up the price.

Here's what you get for $499:

- Intel Core i3-8130U, which is higher performing than the Core i3 Y-series processors found in other Chromebooks but does use a fan to dissipate heat.
- Intel UHD Graphics 620
- 8 GB of memory
- 64 GB of eMMC storage and integrated memory card slot for additional storage
- 14-inch 1920 x 1080 IPS touchscreen
- Backlit keyboard
- 802.11ac Wi-Fi and Bluetooth 4.2
- HD webcam with dual array microphone
- Two USB Type-C ports and one USB Type-A port (all are USB 3.1), microphone and headphone jack
- 60 WHr battery with runtime up to 13.5 hours, per HP
- Weight of 3.7 pounds

I personally haven't used this device, but I trust my pals at Chrome Unboxed when it comes to hands on opinions. Take a peek at their review of the HP Chromebook X360 14 if you're on the fence about this 2-in-1.

Overall, it's not a bad combination of hardware for everyday usage including web browsing, Android apps, and even some occasional Linux applications. And although you can usually find a Google Home Mini on sale for $30 or so, the free smart speaker is a nice bonus.
