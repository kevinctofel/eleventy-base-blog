There's another sale at Best Buy on the [HP Chromebook X360 14c bringing the $629 price down by $100 right now](https://www.bestbuy.com/site/hp-2-in-1-14-touch-screen-chromebook-intel-core-i3-8gb-memory-64gb-emmc-flash-memory-mineral-silver/6407695.p?skuId=6407695). That's not the best deal I've seen on this 2-in-1 Chromebook but it's still decent. This HP Chromebook X360 14c sale gets you a 10th generation Core i3 processor, 8 GB of memory, and 64 GB of storage for $529.

The prior model was quite nice but you're getting a new chipset on this model along with longer support for Chrome OS automatic updates, through June 2028.

In terms of the HP Chromebook X360 14c, I’d call it squarely in the mid-range Chromebook market. Expect plenty of performance for everyday basic use, easily handling 10 to 15 browser tabs open.

You can also throw some full-time Android apps into the mix. The device should handle light Linux use as well but if you plan to run Linux for hours a day, every day, you’d probably want to invest in something a little better.

Here’s what you get: A 10th-gen [Intel Core i3-10110U](https://ark.intel.com/content/www/us/en/ark/products/196451/intel-core-i3-10110u-processor-4m-cache-up-to-4-10-ghz.html) with a 2.1 GHz base frequency, turbo-boost up to 4.1 GHz; a 14-inch full HD touch display with thin bezels on the sides, 8GB of memory, 64GB of eMMC storage, Wi-Fi 6 and Bluetooth 5.

There are a pair of USB Type-C 3.1 SuperSpeed ports and one Type-A, wide-view webcam with privacy shutter, plus a headphone/microphone jack and microSD card reader. HP also packs in a 60.9 wHr battery for all-day use.

Because the chip inside is a U-Series model, it can run longer at full capacity, unlike [Y-Series chips found in the Pixel Slate](https://www.aboutchromebooks.com/reviews/google-pixel-slate-review/), for example.

The one possible downside? U-Series chips require fans to reduce the heat produced during those heavy-duty CPU cycles, so the HP Chromebook X360 does have a fan.

Typically, low-end Chromebooks are in the sub-$200 to $400 price range with relatively less capable Pentium processors and 4 GB of RAM. If you can stretch a little further on price, the HP Chromebook X360 14c sale at $529 is a solid buy. You're going to get better performance and, in most cases, a better and larger screen.
