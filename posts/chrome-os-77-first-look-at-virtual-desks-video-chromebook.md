I had hoped that [virtual workspaces or desks would arrive in Chrome OS 76](https://www.aboutchromebooks.com/news/chrome-os-76-bringing-virtual-desktops-to-chromebooks/), but it appears that the feature will arrive with Chrome OS 77. With "Virtual Desks" you can [group apps or browser tabs on up to four different Chromebook desktops](https://www.aboutchromebooks.com/news/heres-a-video-look-at-the-latest-virtual-desktop-spaces-for-chromebooks/). And it works either with a keyboard and mouse or with a Chrome OS tablet that doesn't have a hardware keyboard.

Here's a demo of how Virtual Desks currently works in the Canary Channel of Chrome OS 77.

Note that I ran through the demo very quickly; this isn't exactly how I'd group my apps and tabs.

For that, I'd likely have work tabs open on one desk, content consumption items on another and perhaps a Linux app for development purposes on a third.

But that's just me and everyone is different. After taking a look at how Virtual Desks works, is it a feature you plan to use, and if so, how?
