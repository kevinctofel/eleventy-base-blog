Today's the day! Google I/O opens up with an expected two-hour keynote at 10am PT and if you can't be on-site at the Shoreline Amphitheater in Mountain View, you can still [catch the event live on the web](https://blog.google/topics/developers/were-live-streaming-google-io/).

Tune in by navigating to the [Google I/O home page](https://google.com/io) to hear all of the announcements. Yes, Android (and, I suspect Google's AI efforts) will be the main draw but I anticipate that [Chrome OS and Chromebooks will share in the spotlight too](https://www.aboutchromebooks.com/news/google-i-o-2018-preview-what-to-expect-for-chrome-os/). Note that all of the developer-focused sessions will be recorded and [later shared on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/user/GoogleDevelopers) for those who are interested.

Also, right after the keynote ends, I'll be joining [This Week in Google](https://twit.tv/shows/this-week-in-google) on video for an overview and thoughts on the announcements. Consider tuning in at [TwIT.tv](https://www.twit.tv) to hear live reactions from me and others on everything Google announced at the main keynote!
