After [running Linux apps on my Pixelbook using the Dev Channel](https://www.aboutchromebooks.com/news/first-look-running-full-linux-apps-on-a-chromebook-with-project-crostini/) for the past few months, I'm looking forward to doing the same on the Beta Channel. And at last check, Chrome OS 69 is the version that should bring [Project Crostini](https://www.aboutchromebooks.com/tag/project-crostini) to that channel. It could happen this week.

Based on the Chromium OS schedule, the Beta version of Chrome OS 69 is slated for August 2, which is this Thursday.

[![](images/Chrome-OS-69-beta-date.png)](https://www.aboutchromebooks.com/news/project-crostini-linux-apps-chrome-os-beta-release-date/attachment/chrome-os-69-beta-date/)The schedule of release dates isn't set in stone of course; any major testing bugs or other issues could impact the release date, so we'll have to watch the [Chrome Release blog](https://chromereleases.googleblog.com/) to see if there's an official announcement this week. In fact, Project Crostini was originally slated for Beta and Stable version 68, but [Google pushed it back to 69 about a month ago](https://www.aboutchromebooks.com/news/project-crostini-linux-apps-chromebooks-release-date-chrome-69/).

It may sound silly that I'm looking forward to the new version on the Beta Channel, but keep in mind: Running on the Dev Channel brings all sorts of other bugs and issues as the software matures. Yes, I'll still have my Linux app support, so I'm not gaining much there. However, the new version will also bring some added stability as bugs found in the Dev Channel are squashed.

I don't expect all of the yet unsupported features of Crostini to be added with the next Beta Channel software though. Based on a [very recent presentation of Crostini](https://www.aboutchromebooks.com/news/video-how-project-crostini-works-run-linux-apps-on-chromebooks/), the development team is still working on items such as support for GPU acceleration and USB devices.

If all goes well with the new Beta Channel, look for all of the features to drop into a Stable Channel release on or around September 11.
