Back in May, [Google One was announced as a rebrand of Drive storage.](https://www.aboutchromebooks.com/news/need-more-drive-storage-for-your-chromebook-google-one-makes-it-cheaper/) Initially, the updated storage was an invite-only but [as of today, Google says it's available for all in the U.S](https://www.blog.google/products/google-one/upgrade-google-one-get-more-out-google/). Even better, there are few more goodies for Google One users.

The Google One storage plans are used across Drive, Photos and Gmail, with the following price tiers:

- 100 GB for $1.99
- 200 GB for $2.99 (This is a new plan)
- 2 TB for $9.99 (Was $19.99 prior to Google One)
- 10 TB for $99.99
- 20 TB for $199.99
- 30 TB for $299.99

The storage can be shared by six Gmail accounts through Family Sharing, so you don't need a Google One plan for everyone at home, unless you want that, of course. Google One also provides 24/7 support; something that was previously only for G Suite accounts.

And here are the extras that Google added since the initial announcement:

> With Google One, you’ll also get extra benefits across Google. We’ve started with credits on Google Play and deals on hotels found in Google Search. In the coming months, keep an eye out for Google Store and Google Express benefits and more.

I'm all for Google Play credits -- they're handy for both apps and movies -- and I'm sure some travelers will appreciate hotel deals. Of course, all of these benefits keep in you in the Google-verse, so if that's not your thing, these won't appeal.

Note that the Google One page still showed an invite-only page for me at time of writing. It could be rolling out in stages during the day today. Since I can never have enough storage (I care less about local storage for how I work), I'll likely add some more for my Chromebooks.
