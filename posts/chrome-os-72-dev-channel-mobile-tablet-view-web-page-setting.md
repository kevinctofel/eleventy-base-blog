Last month we heard that [Google would be adding a mobile-friendly web page view to Chrome OS devices](https://www.aboutchromebooks.com/news/virtual-desktop-workspaces-and-mobile-website-views-coming-to-chromebooks-and-chrome-tablets/) and the feature is now available in the latest Dev Channel update for Chrome OS 72. The idea here is to provide the option of a mobile page view on tablets if the user desires it, making the user experience a bit better for touchscreen-only devices such as the Pixel Slate.

To add the feature, you obviously need to be on the latest Dev Channel of Chrome OS -- [here's how to get there](https://www.aboutchromebooks.com/qa/whats-the-difference-between-developer-mode-and-the-dev-channel-on-a-chromebook/) -- and then enable the following flag: _chrome://flags/#enable-request-tablet-site_. Once enabled, restart your device and you'll have the feature.

At the bottom of the options list, you'll see a "Request tablet site" option. Tap it and if there's a mobile-formatted version of the site you're viewing, the page should reload with the same view you'd see on an Android phone.

Here's a standard desktop view of Techmeme, for example, followed by the same page after requesting the tablet site.

When word of this feature first becameÂ known, I suggested that it would be [more effective for Chrome tablets with smaller screens](https://www.aboutchromebooks.com/news/virtual-desktop-workspaces-and-mobile-website-views-coming-to-chromebooks-and-chrome-tablets/), such as the 9.7-inch Acer Chromebook Tab 10. After using it for a bit on my 12.3-inch Pixel Slate, I feel the same way. Even more so.

With a large display, there's less need for a mobile formatted web page, both from an information density and touch target standpoint; especially if you have a keyboard accessory with a generously sized trackpad at the ready. Even when in slate mode without the keyboard, I haven't yet found a site that wasn't easy to navigate with the Pixel Slate's touchscreen.

As a result, I'll likely never use this function. For device owners with a smaller display -- and I expect that the Acer Chromebook Tab 10 won't be the only small Chrome tablet on the market for long -- this is a great option to have.

Note that the Dev Channel of Chrome OS is a work in progress, so you may encounter bugs that you haven't see on the Stable Channel. And if you go back from the Dev Channel to the Stable Channel, there's a good chance that all of your local data will be lost due to a Chrome OS Powerwash reset.
